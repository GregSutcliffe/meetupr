        <br></span></p>\\n<p><span>All our walks are well researched, leaving you
        free to relax and enjoy the lovely scenery or urban views in the company of

        from just a couple of miles covering historical sights to longer urban or
        country walks of over over ten miles and are either just a couple of hours

        Explorers</a></b> and often do events together. Chiltern explorers is based
        to the west of London in the gorgeous Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural

        National Parks and other AONBs.</span></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/4/7/600_454593863.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><span>Chiltern
        Explorers is unusual for many outdoor meetup groups in that it currently only
        arranges the walks and leaves the accommodation up to the members giving members
        the option to go on the days they want and stay according to their budget,
        many members also car share for trips away. The weekends have a good social
        atmosphere and comradery. <br></span></p>\\n<p><span>The London walks have
        covered such diverse subjects as Jack the Ripper, James Bond, Sherlock Holmes,
        Wren Churches, Fryscrapers and Walkie-Scorchies, London Parks and Canals amongst
        many other themed walks. <br> <br>The country walks have covered the Chiltern

        people in South West London...and Beyond!</b></p>\\n<p>Welcome to The Future.
        As technology continues to advance the way we interact has changed. However,
        are we turning into pixelated avatars lost in virtual worlds?&nbsp;Studies
        have shown that people constantly 'connected' are starting to find their online
        lives hollow, unsatisfying and actually stressful. They want to return to
        the <i>real</i> -- face to face interaction, sharing of experiences and feeling
        real emotions. They want to re-engage with the <i>authentic human experience</i>.</p>\\n<p>Are
        you the kind of person that wants more, demands more and&nbsp;expects more
        from life? Are the kind of person that is willing to take personal responsibility
        and put the effort in to make a change in your life? If so this group is for
        you. </p>\\n<p>We are based in South West London but we host events throughout&nbsp;London.&nbsp;Cool
        events for cool people, where you can&nbsp;participate in genuine and fun
        activities, and make real and meaningful connections. Rather than random events
        and aloof encounters, where you remain anonymous,&nbsp;we want there to be
        more involvement in this group --&nbsp; it's not&nbsp;about us, we want this
        group to be about <b>YOU</b>. </p>\\n<p>We want to build a sense of community
        here so we are looking for genuine people with a generosity of spirit -- not
        transients, people with apathy or those who are only looking out&nbsp;for
        their own self-interest. As such we require applicants to answer 3 simple
        questions and to put on a real photo of themselves on their profile. <br></p>\\n<p>We
        hope you'll have a good time...</p>\\n<p><b>GROUP RULES</b></p>\\n<p> 1) Be
        nice. </p>\\n<p>2) 3 Strikes and you're out. We go out of our way to organise
        and host events, so be respectful. If you RSVP for an event and fail to attend
        this will constitute as one strike. If you withdraw your RSVP less than 24
        hours before the start of an event this constitute as a strike. If you accumulate
        3 strikes you will be removed from the group. </p>\\n<p>3) If you have not
        attended at least one event or have remained inactive for 6 months your membership
        will be rescinded. </p>\\n<p>4) We will supply the address, map and if necessary
        directions to venues. We trust members will be competent enough to arrive
        at venues on their own. </p>\\n<p>5) Any changes to events will be announced
        as soon as is humanly possible. It is advised that members check the website
        and their e-mail prior to an event. </p>\\n<p>6) We will be unable to answer
        questions and respond to comments on the events page once an event has started.
        </p>\\n<p>7) We regrettably reserve the right to refuse non-members who attempt
        to gatecrash our events (of course not including sanctioned guests of members).
        </p>\\n<p>8) The forums and mailing list are for group use. They may not be
        used to advertise products and services or other groups and events. </p>\\n<p>9)
        The forum and mailing list are public, so discretion is advised when posting.

        We Do&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Day Trips:&nbsp;</b>We usually meet on a Saturday
        morning at a London train station before heading out into the countryside
        for a days walk together before getting the train back into town in the early
        evening. Our walks are typically around 10 miles in length and we like to
        have a good mix of hills and valleys and woods and rivers, usually with a
        castle, a windmill or a hilltop beacon to enjoy along the way. At the end
        of the hike we have the option of going for a drink or a meal together in
        a local pub near to the train station, you don't have to come to the pub but
        it's a great way to finish off the day by relaxing and chatting to new friends
        before heading home.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Weekends Away:</b><span>&nbsp;As well
        as the South East we also organise hiking trip weekends across the UK. We
        are big fans of the Peak District and other National Parks and have some super
        little adventure breaks planned to historic English cities too. All of our
        weekends are based around hiking with some activity options available,&nbsp;
        as well as going out for dinner together on the Saturday night. Usually we
        travel out from London after work on the Friday and come back on the Sunday
        afternoon. In general you buy your train ticket and get to the hostel but
        after that we look after you&nbsp; - so you don't need a car to come with
        us. People really enjoy our weekends - have a look at the comments sections
        on previous trips - hopefully you will too!</span></p>\\n<p><span><b>Socialising:</b></span><span>
        All of our hikes are a great chance to meet new people and make new friends.
        We are a relaxed group and there is plenty of space to breathe the air, enjoy
        the views and then chat to the others as the mood takes you. Many people come
        on their own and we make sure everyone is welcome, others like to bring a
        friend as their guest. It\\u2019s up to you. Most of our walks have a pub
        stop in the middle and we always have a chance to go for a meal and a drink
        together at the end.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Exploring: </b><span>There\\u2019s
        so much to see and do and lots of it is not too far outside London. Come along
        and discover The North and South Downs Way, Arundel Castle, The Otford Solar
        System, The Angel on the Bridge, The River Thames, The Shivering Mountain,
        The Chiltern Hills, Beachy Head Cliffs, Jack and Jill, Gallows Down and much
        more. We\\u2019ve been to lots of places, now we want to take you too. Come
        along and have fun!</span></p>\\n<p><span><b>Safety:</b>&nbsp;Tom is a qualified
        Hill and Moorland Leader (MLTE). Mark is qualified Mountain Leader (MLTE).
        Both hold current Outdoor First Aid certificates. All of the hikes we take
        you on have been tried out before to make sure they are suitable and we aim
        to minimise risk through careful planning, good organisation, experience and
        skill. We take your safety seriously and have a risk policy published under
        our terms and conditions.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/0/600_370500192.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>FAQs</b>
        <br></p>\\n<p><span><b>Can I come on my own?</b></span> Yes, most people do
        although you are welcome to bring a friend or sign up a guest. We make sure
        everyone is very welcome and there will be lots of people to talk to as you
        are going along.</p>\\n<p><span><b>What are the costs?</b></span><span>&nbsp;We
        keep our costs simple and there are no hidden things to pay for. Typically
        you will pay a £5 organiser fee for a day hike securely on PayPal through
        the Meetup site. Please note we don\\u2019t do refunds unless the walk is
        cancelled.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span><b>What should I wear?</b></span><span>
        We ask you to wear sensible walking clothes and shoes, preferably hiking boots,
        taking into account the weather forecast and time of year. This normally includes
        a waterproof.&nbsp;The terrain may be uneven or slippery and therefore fashion
        boots, shoes or boots with heels, smooth leather soles, fashion trainers or
        plimsoles are NOT suitable (This list is not exhaustive).</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span><b>What
        should I bring?</b></span><span>&nbsp;On most of our walks we ask you to bring
        a packed lunch or buy a sandwich at the station before we set off. Always
        bring water, &nbsp;we suggest one litre. You may also need to bring sunscreen,
        a hat and/or waterproofs depending on weather forecast/season. A day-sack
        (rucksack) to carry your lunch and you may like to bring a camera and some
        money to buy a drink or a meal in the pub at the end.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span><b>How
        fit do you need to be?</b></span><span> We are not one of the fastest &nbsp;hiking
        groups but you do need a reasonable level of fitness to complete the length
        of walk (usually around 10 miles) and remember there will be some hills along
        the way.</span></p>\\n<p><span><b>Is this an established, trustworthy, hiking
        group?</b></span><span>&nbsp;Yes. We have been going strong since December
        2011 and currently have nearly 16,000 members. But don't take our word for
        it. Check out individual walk reviews or a group review to see what other
        Explorers thought.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span><b>Will I enjoy the hike and
        have fun?</b></span><span> We certainly hope so! Why not check out some of
        our reviews to see what a good time people have.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span>Hope
        to see you on a hike soon, best wishes</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span>Tom and

        I therefore thought it was about time to up the tally and see some new places
        in the capital. While I have a good social life in London, I don't really
        know people who like hitting a museum, historical exhibition or random old
        place in the way I do. I thought I can't be the only one so decided to have
        a crack at a meetup group for people around my age.</p>\\n<p>I aim to mix
        up a museum trip with a coffee house meeting point before and a pub social
        after. I will also put together a short quiz sheet before every visit for
        you to find out more about where we are going as we have a cup of coffee.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span>To
        cover admin costs I have decided to charge £1 per trip. I did um and ah about
        this, but I hope members appreciate that it does cost something to run a meetup
        group and members will be OK will it. The original price was £2 but as the
        group has been successful and I am making back the costs of running the group
        I have reduced the event price for 2019.</span><br></p>\\n<p>So if you are
        a person in your thirties or forties looking to fill a history shaped hole

        <br></p>\\n<p>Why not be a tourist and an explorer in your own city? <br>Whether
        you have just moved to London or have lived here all your life: this is an
        invitation to you, if deep down inside you have an adventurer and explorer
        waiting to come out! <br>This group is being set up to run once a month Hidden
        London full days out to explore the wonderful,magical hidden gems in London!
        The idea is to create a full day out every month of discovering London with
        fresh eyes and a spirit of adventure, adding a bit of old London and new London
        into the mix of discovery mainly focusing on hidden nooks and crannies that
        tourists overlook or don't know about.Museums, galleries,historical pubs,hidden
        alleyways, unusual places of historical value, restaurants that are a bit
        unusual etc... I have a few ideas, but would welcome yours. <br>-Exploring
        the borough of Charles Dickens <br>-Exploring the secret spaces of Bermondsey
        that includes an outside library. <br>-The idyllic ruins of St Dunstan-in-the-East.&nbsp;
        <br>-Borough market delicacies <br>-And a cornucopia of old hidden gems like
        a medieval crypt, the punishment cell of the Knights Templar, a church that
        shows scars from World War II, and the location of a long-lost Underground
        station.</p>\\n<p>It doesn't matter if you've lived in London for years and
        never really got to explore it properly or you've just moved to London to
        live here ...anyone of any age is welcome. (this is only for adults, children
        and babies not allowed due to practical reasons).</p>\\n<p>IS THIS GROUP FOR
        YOU? <br></p>\\n<p>This is for you if you are an adventurer/explorer at heart,
        you are open to new experiences,curious and energetic and enthusiastic about
        life and living in London and exploring its history and what it has become.
        <br></p>\\n<p>For me the lure of setting up this group wasn't just about getting
        out the house one day a month to explore London. It goes deeper than that:
        it's about creating a sense of novelty,awe and wonder about our lives and
        our surroundings. For all we think we know so well and there's nothing left
        to discover, once we decide we are at heart \\\"intrepid explorers\\\" in
        our own lives and in our own city then we can choose to see everything around
        us with curiosity and fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder. It's an almost
        child like ability of playfulness, that we tend to lose as we become adults.
        This is what I hope to achieve with this group: recapture our sense of playfulness,
        discovery and wonder, while making connections with others!&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I
        spent years working in top 5 star hotels as a Concierge so I got to know all
        the secret places that few people know about in London. In addition to that
        I have a passion for London and it's unique character and all the gems it
        hides in plain sight!I have escorted some friends and even business clients
        through London and they all loved how they were shown parts of London they
        didn't expect to see, and how much they enjoyed it! Plus I feel extremely
        flattered&nbsp; that since I came up with the idea for this group(there was
        nothing exactly like this being offered on Meet Up before) that several other
        groups like this one have been set up, which is really exciting because any
        groups getting people out exploring London with a new sense freshness&nbsp;
        and curiosity is always a good thing!</p>\\n<p><span>HOW WILL IT WORK:&nbsp;</span>
        <br></p>\\n<p>Once a month I will be running a hidden London day out. These
        will usually be run on a&nbsp; Saturday or Sunday, so that anyone who works
        during the week, can attend. The meet up place will be sent three days before
        the event and the places we will be exploring during the event&nbsp; day will
        remain secret until we meet up on the day out when all will be revealed where
        we will be going for the day. Please note this is not being run as a traditional
        run of the mill guided tour. This is a group where I will be arranging the
        places we visit for the day(with everyone's input very welcome) I will give
        some information about each place we will be going to, however anyone wishing
        to give out additional info about any place we visit is welcome to do so.
        The idea is to have a fun,collaborative,&nbsp; interactive and engaging experience
        with everyone involved instead of having a guide person drone on about facts
        for several hours.<span>&nbsp;Lunch will happen middle of the day(and a chance
        to rest our weary feet) and then we will end the day at a pub/coffee shop
        to grab a drink/beverage before we head home!</span></p>\\n<p><span> <br></span></p>\\n<p>WHAT
        YOU WILL NEED? <br>All you will need is a good pair of walking shoes, a brollie(just
        in case there are any droplets! This is London after all.. ) and a day pass
        to travel on bus/underground to get around for the day and on the occasion
        that we will need to go somewhere where admission needs to be paid, then each
        person needs to pay for this themselves.This will apply to having lunch or
        pub/coffee shop drinks/beverages too. I am planning to factor in as many places
        as possible where there will not be extra costs involved, however this is
        not always going to be possible. The £5 fee is to to cover the cost,time and
        research to put together these events. Please be aware that while I will be
        happy to take suggestions on board (and highly recommend it)this&nbsp; fee
        is not refundable if you do not like the places that we will be visiting,
        as my focus is going to be about seeing as much of hidden London as possible.So

        We tend to meet once a month, usually on the first Friday, for a pub crawl
        and visit three bars in the one evening. It's a fantastic way of meeting new
        people, making friends and discovering more of gay London. It is always great
        night out - everyone is fun, friendly and welcoming! Pub crawls usually attract
        70-80 guys. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>TENPIN BOWLING NIGHT: We usually hold a gay
        bowling night once a month at All.Star Lanes. These are hosted and you get
        to play two games of bowling. You can come along on your own or with friends.
        Again, everyone is fun and friendly.</p> \\n<p>There are many who regularly
        attend these meetups plus there are always lots of new people joining us.

        to circle of friends, this group is aimed at getting like minded people together
        to make real friendships and to explore what London has to offer. </p>\\n<p>We
        both have quite varied interests and also like trying new things so the events
        we put on will be quite a variety, we are as happy in a city bar at happy
        hour as we are in a dingy pub watching a band! </p>\\n<p>We are aware how
        expensive London can be so we will aim to do events that are affordable to
        all so please don't expect trips to musicals, cocktail bars that charge £20
        a drink or Michelin starred restaurants, (unless we can find a really really
        good deal or you know the owner and we get a discount ;) )</p>\\n<p>We will
        also try and pick places that are easy to get to and stick with zone 1-2 unless
        there is something really cool to do that's worth venturing further out. </p>\\n<p>I
        have found from being a member of other meetups that restricting numbers at
        each event is a good way of really get to know people. Drinks will have a
        much bigger number but dinners, crazy golf, museum trips etc will probably
        only have 10-12 spaces. </p>\\n<p>A few housekeeping rules!</p>\\n<p>If you
        rsvp but can no longer make it please change your rsvp, this will not only
        allow someone else the chance to go it also stops the organisers looking like
        <br> idiots if they end up on their own or looking out for you and delaying
        the event thinking you\\u2019re turning up! </p>\\n<p>This is a friendly group
        so please be nice, everyone has differences and are passionate about different
        things so don't make anyone feel bad or guilty for not agreeing with you.
        </p>\\n<p>Just for expectations sake and because of a few \\\"interesting\\\"
        experiences at other mixed groups, this is not a dating group, so please don't
        hit on everything that moves. however we know things can happen so if you
        do meet \\\"the one\\\" great as long as we at least get a bit wedding cake
        or mention in the speech!</p>\",\"created\":1523811753000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        London\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/tglondon/\",\"urlname\":\"tglondon\",\"description\":\"<p>Hi.</p>\\n<p>We
        are what the world calls TVs, CDs, TSs, Transvestites, Crossdressers, Transsexuals
        a Treasgendered people. <br> The reality is these are just labels. <br> In
        order for the world and the people in it to be at peace with themselves, everything
        and everyone must have a label and these are ours.</p>\\n<p>This group is
        for Londoners wanting to meet other like-minded people for discussions and
        to gain support from each other.</p>\\n<p>The object of this group is to provide
        a connection, advice, peace of mind and help to Transvestites/Crossdressers
        and their wives, partners and families. <br> The aim is to give assistance
        and advice based on personal experience and knowledge gained through discussion
        with other TVs/CDs and their friends and relations. <br> It is also an aim
        to provide the opportunity to those who need it, a chance to make contact
        with someone who is in a position for one to air ones feelings to with no
        prejudice from the anyone.</p>\\n<p>It is the intention to have meetups twice
        a month. <br> One will be an opportunity to meet like minded people in \\u201cdrab\\u201d
        (in your everyday street clothes) in locations where all can relax in the
        real world and communicate about our unusual life style, hobby, passion, call
        it what you will. These will be in pubs, clubs, restaurants, theatres even
        museums, for tea/coffee, a drink or what ever the group members fancy. <br>
        A group already exists who only meet in drab in a pub once a month. I want
        to take our social meets in drab beyond the pub. This will also give the opportunity
        for partners who know to accompany members and feel in their world.</p>\\n<p>The
        second will be an opportunity to dress en femme at safe London venues, preferably
        with changing facilities. Partners will be welcome here also.</p>\\n<p>To
        make things fair, all will be expected to contribute at the meetups. A nominal
        £3.00 to cover the cost of having the group posted on Meet-up and any other
        admin costs i.e. phone calls, photocopying/printing etc.. This is common with
        many Meet-up groups when they actually meet at a venue. <br> A meet will only
        take place if five or more members commit to attend the meetup. Please post
        your RSVP as soon as possible even if it is a \\u201cNo\\u201d . This will
        help to avoid disappointment as some events could have limited availability
        due to the nature of the venue.</p>\\n<p>Themed events will be planned to
        help and advice, particularly new to the scene members of do\\u2019s and don\\u2019ts.
        Experienced and long time, out on the scene members are encouraged to share
        their knowledge.</p>\\n<p>The purpose of this group is to make new friends
        and meet like minded people in safe and friendly environments. Somewhere Granny
        would not feel too much out of place.</p>\\n<p>Check out our web site also

        to London Social Walks, formally known as Unseen Tours. This group is all
        about Walking, Socialising, and having Fun in London!</p> \\n<p>We are a multi-award-winning
        not for profit social enterprise offering walking tours of London led by homeless
        and/or vulnerably housed individuals. We have co-constructed every aspect
        of the tours with the guides themselves, showcasing their personality, creativity
        and resourcefulness.</p> \\n<p>If you're new to London, this is a great chance
        for you to make new friends and find out more about this amazing city. If
        you\\u2019ve lived in London for a while, you surely don\\u2019t want to miss
        the occasion to meet new people and discover the greatest secrets that even
        most Londoners don\\u2019t know about! &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Each of our tours
        is incredibly unique and eye-opening, and it will give you the opportunity
        to see the city from a totally unusual perspective. Our aim is to show London\\u2019s
        historical and cultural quirks in a different and entertaining way. The issues
        of homelessness are also covered to make a point about the state of the world
        we live in and highlight social injustice. Crucially, our tours are not tours
        of the homeless but, rather, WITH them.</p> \\n<p>So please join us for one
        of our regular walks which conclude in a hand-picked pub! &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>We
        operate on a \\u2018pay as you feel\\u2019 basis: our guides haven\\u2019t
        set a price, because YOU will be the one doing it! (Yes, they are this confident
        that you are going to love it! ;) Also, all of our tours have a 5 star rating
        on Tripadvisor). So at the end of the tour you will decide how much it was
        worth for you. Our guides rely on contributions from amazing people like you
        to take care of their daily needs!</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>\",\"created\":1323609801000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        to <b>London Weekend Walks</b>.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>If you're looking for short
        weekend walks in London (approx. 2 hours at a steady pace) then this group
        is for you. My walks are open to all, they are interesting and fun and offer
        you a chance to socialise with new people and see more of London. Walks will
        go ahead whatever the weather so if it's raining please do wear appropriate
        clothing. Most walks will be on pavements so won't be muddy. Some will be
        through parks.</p>\\n<p>Our walking pace is leisurely and I explore different
        and interesting parts of London - and always end in a good pub for an optional
        post-walk drink for those of you who'd like to stay and socalise after the
        walk.</p>\\n<p>Open to all. All ages - all abilities. Children are very welcome
        and dogs are welcome too (at no cost).</p>\\n<p>All walks will start and end
        near a tube station so are easy to get to and depart from. I make a small
        charge per person for each meetup event (payable in cash at the start of the
        meetup - usually £4 per walk) to cover my expenses, tax and time in organising
        the meetup.</p>\\n<p>I also&nbsp;have a WhatsApp broadcast list so you can
        receive a <b>single message</b> via WhatsApp around a week before a walk is
        coming up. This is not a group so you won't receive endless messages, nor
        can other people reply to the list or see your mobile number. It is a simple
        list and when a walk is coming up I send out a message via WhatsApp to advise
        everyone of the walk details. If you'd like to join this list please send
        a message to me (Kumar) via the Meetup website or app with your mobile number.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>So
        if you want to have some fun, see more of London, socialise, chat to other
        people, get some exercise and go on nice walks in London then join us. Please
        ensure you attend at least one walk in six months as inactive members will
        be removed.</p>\\n<p>By attending a walk on this Meetup group you confirm
        that you agree to, and accept, all the Terms stated at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/londonweekendwalks/pages/28491884/Terms/\\\">https://www.meetup.com/londonweekendwalks/pages/28491884/Terms/</a>.

        <br></p>\\n<p><span>This is a Group promoting&nbsp;</span><b>'The Blood and
        Tears Walk'</b><span> - the London walk about serial killers (and other creepy
        stuff), which I have performed to 60,000 people from across the world in the
        last 22 years.</span><br></p>\\n<p>The walk begins at<b> 7pm</b> on <b>Wednesday,
        Thursday and Friday nights</b>.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The first 45 minutes of this
        2 hour tour is about execution sites, seemingly impossible prison escapes,
        grave-robbing, hidden rivers and the like, and, of course, <b>serial killers</b>.
        The last 1 hour and 15 minutes of the tour moves into much more chilling and
        grim territory, and is almost entirely about London serial killers - NOT just
        <b>Jack the Ripper</b>. Unlike most other London serial killer/True Crime
        tours, who almost always just feature Jack, I feature <b>other London serial
        killers as well</b>. There are profiling exercises on the Tour, and increasingly
        creepy locations. </p>\\n<p>As the author of the bestselling <b>'Bloody London'</b>
        (8,500 copies sold by January 2021) which features 16 London serial killers
        and much else, I know a lot about the subject. There is a ton of information
        on the tour, but I am NOT dry and academic. I am friendly and welcoming, connect
        with people, and it's my mission to make the tour absorbing and immersive.
        <i>Every time</i>. With&nbsp;<span>nearly 600 TripAdvisor reviews of 'The
        Blood &amp; Tears Walk' and over 81% 5-star reviews, it seems I have succeeded!</span></p>\\n<p>Plus,
        as an ex-professional actor, I know how to ramp up the tension and spring
        psychological surprises, and I specialise in cinematic story-telling with
        lots of atmosphere. <i>I aim to make this experience highly memorable...</i></p>\\n<p>If
        you want to meet up with friends afterwards, the Tour ends at around <b>9pm</b>
        at&nbsp;<span>the wonderful&nbsp; <b>Princess Louise pub&nbsp;</b></span><span>(there's&nbsp;
        a serial killer connection of course), just 90 seconds from Holborn underground
        station, on the street called High Holborn.</span></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\",\"created\":1565260150000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        of the main reasons people search for London walking groups is to escape the
        city at the weekend. The pace of life in London is very different to the sorts
        of places we visit on our trips. There are limitless hiking trails within
        the UK that offer a complete contrast in scenery to an overcrowded, busy city
        like London. We visit all the most popular national parks, each of which has
        its own character and charm. These national parks offer some of the best mountain
        views and stunning coastal scenery that you are likely to see anywhere.</p>\\n<p>A
        great balance in terms of group sizes, standard of accommodation and variety
        of locations visited. A trip away with The London Adventure Group is a great
        way to get that much needed fresh air and healthy exercise. Add in some lovely
        country pub food and the chance to meet lots of interesting, like minded people
        and what are you waiting for? Why not join us on an adventure soon?</p>\",\"created\":1522083719000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        religious and like to sing? Based in or near London? Free on Tuesday evenings?</b></p>
        \\n<p>Then this is the choir for you. The London Humanist Choir (previously
        the British Humanist Association Choir) was formed in 2009 and we have sung
        in the open, on stage, on TV, on radio and in the Underground.</p> \\n<p>We
        are a mixed-ability choir, and there are no auditions for new members. You
        don\\u2019t even have to be able to read music. But we do need your enthusiasm
        and commitment. We sing to celebrate the joy (and occasional pain) of living.
        We learn a lot from each other, and when we get it right, we make quite a
        nice noise. We certainly have fun trying.</p> \\n<p>During the pandemic we
        have flipped to Zoom online choir. Contact members@london.humanistchoir.org
        to for the link and further info.<br> <br><b>Origins</b></p> \\n<p>The choir
        was set up in May 2009 with a legacy dedicated to the composition of some
        humanist songs, and the creation of a choir to sing them. We have since performed
        in London and round the UK at humanist events, stand-up comedy gigs, private
        parties, our own concerts, and on the street. We have even made some recordings
        and a video, and performed at weddings and funerals.</p> \\n<p><b>Rehearsals</b></p>
        \\n<p>We rehearse on Tuesdays between 7pm and 9pm in central London. See practice
        details for venue information.</p> \\n<p>Please aim to get to rehearsals at
        about 6.45pm so that we can get registration out of the way and start warming
        up promptly at 7pm. Afterwards, you will be more than welcome to join us in
        a nearby pub for a drink or something to eat.</p> \\n<p><b>Performances</b></p>
        \\n<p>Our rehearsals are geared towards performances throughout the year.

        Cinema Meetup\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/London-Cinema/\",\"urlname\":\"London-Cinema\",\"description\":\"<p>This
        is the group to join if you like to watch films in London and enjoy meeting
        new people. <span>We go to see a wide variety of films, including both the
        new releases and classic films.&nbsp;</span><span>We use various cinemas,
        usually in central London. Come by yourself, or bring a friend if you want.
        Adults of all ages/nationalities are welcome. There is always an opportunity
        to socialise with the other members after the films if you want. <br> <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;The
        following guidelines apply to London Cinema Meetup events: <br> <br>(1) Any
        meetup event must have an Event Organiser. You are welcome to suggest a film
        event, but to make sure it happens why not volunteer to take this role?&nbsp;The
        Event Organiser must name a particular cinema, film and film start time and
        commit to attending and performing the organiser roles (see below). Ideally
        events are announced up to a week in advance (once the cinema's film showings
        have been announced). If you are a new Event Organiser, please send a message
        to me (or to an Assistant Organiser) to request help setting up the event
        on Meetup. Usually Central London locations (in zone 1) are preferred as these
        are convenient for more members to reach. Any type of film is OK, whether
        a latest release or a classic. <br> <br>(2) In general London Cinema Meetup
        events should not be for members of this group only. This helps to ensure
        clear communication and avoids conflicts of interest.</p>\\n<p>(3) Please
        only reply Yes to an event if you are planning to attend, and change your
        reply to No if you cannot go for some reason. <br> <br>(4) The Event Organiser
        will be at the cinema (near where tickets are purchased) at least 15 minutes
        before the publicised start time (usually he/she will hold a London Cinema
        Meetup sign, wear some particular item of clothing, and/or provide a mobile
        phone number).&nbsp;If you do not manage to find the group or want to arrive
        later then please just go in and enjoy watching the film by yourself. You
        can try leaving a message on the meetup event site or send a text to the Event
        Organiser's phone, but neither of these will be checked during the film.</p>\\n<p>(5)
        Please buy your own film tickets. Buying in advance is recommended to get
        the best seats and to be sure of getting a place. If seat numbers are stated
        on the tickets, the Event Organiser will write his/her seat number in the
        event description or in the comments section, so that you can sit nearby if
        you wish. If you want you can write their own seat number in a comment for
        the event. <br></p>\\n<p>(6) Currently there are no meetup charge for organising
        these events (note that the group's Organiser is paying monthly charges to
        Meetup). Event Organisers are volunteers who will do their best to welcome
        you and to enable you to meet other attendees, but they are also there to
        enjoy the film so do not expect them to worry if you are late or in the wrong
        place. Please make an effort to welcome all other members. <br> <br>(7) After
        the film you are encoraged to meet the Event Organiser back at the original
        meeting place in the cinema (he/she will try to be there until 10 minutes
        after the film credits have ended). If you want you can go on to socialise
        in a nearby venue (a cafe, pub/bar or restaurant). Attendance is completely
        optional and of course you can feel free to leave at any time. It may be necessary
        to split into smaller groups if there are lots of members going to the film
        or if the chosen venues are crowded. The Event Organiser will usually decide
        where to go (you can always make a suggestion if you want) and will either
        attend himself/herself or if unable to attend will help members who want to
        go to form a group. <br> <br>I hope you enjoy your membership of the group!

        The Latest Update On The Coronavirus Pandemic Please Read Further Below.)</p>
        \\n<p>WELCOME to the largest, most active, and friendliest real-world queer
        vegan group on the planet outside of a global pandemic (probably!). This group
        exists as a hub for creating fun, inclusive, and safe events for people who
        identify as vegan and LGBT+, and for their friends and supporters. We are
        continually increasing the number of members and event organisers, and when
        not in a global pandemic we regularly have a wide variety of different events
        that are suitable for vegans and LGBT+ folks.</p> \\n<p>If you live in London
        or just pass through occasionally, we want you to be a part of our queer vegan
        world. Come along to our events, make new friends, and enjoy the best of queer
        and vegan London!</p> \\n<p>Your ideas for events are welcome (please read
        further below for more details).</p> \\n<p>See you at our get togethers!</p>
        \\n<p>LGBT+ = Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Non-binary/Gender
        Fluid/Gender Queer, Asexual, Aromantic, Demisexual, Pansexual, etc. This group
        is only for adults.</p> \\n<p>★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</p> \\n<p>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE:
        <br>26/12/2020</p> \\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is unfortunately very much
        still with us and will likely continue until the Spring of 2021 and possibly
        longer, as will the restrictions imposed by the UK government. </p> \\n<p>To
        limit the spread of the virus and to keep people safe, it is sensible to continue
        to postpone all real world events for now, and in particular to not have indoor
        events such as at restaurants/pubs/bars etc, which are a much higher risk.
        This will be reviewed regularly based upon the latest evidence and scientific
        advice.</p> \\n<p>There have so far been a large number of deaths and many
        more have suffered directly from the virus in the UK. Whether you believe
        the virus is real, a hoax, a conspiracy, caused by aliens, or 'a trivial disease
        that's no worse than a cold', it is safer and kinder to be cautious in order
        to avoid any further potential harm and deaths. As such, this group will be
        following the current evidence and scientific advice in reducing the risk
        to members and others. </p> \\n<p>The LGBT+ Vegans London group will act in
        a responsible and caring manner, putting the health and well-being of its
        members and non-members at the heart of it's conduct, and we will continue
        to follow all reasonable health guidance and restrictions to limit the spread
        and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This approach will be reviewed regularly
        based upon the latest evidence and scientific advice. It is likely, though,
        that there will be further government restrictions in the coming months as
        a result of an increase in the spread and health impact of the virus.</p>
        \\n<p>Meanwhile, please take a look at the online events that are listed on
        the group's meetup webpages.</p> \\n<p>Hopefully, once the pandemic is under
        control and safer days are with us, we will once again meet up for fab vegan
        nibbles, friendly conversations, laughter, and fun.</p> \\n<p>Until then,
        please look after yourselves and stay safe. By protecting yourself you will
        protect others.</p> \\n<p>Sun<br>Organiser</p> \\n<p>★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</p>
        \\n<p>THE REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF:</p> \\n<p>RESPECT: We are an inclusive group
        and as such we welcome everyone, regardless of gender, race, skin colour,
        nationality, sexuality, age, appearance, ability, health, social and economic
        situation, etc. We do not tolerate any form of hate or abuse at our events,
        on our meetup group, or on any other social media we may use. Any members
        who are disrespectful, abusive, aggressive, bullying, gaslighting, intimidating,
        threatening, harassing, hateful, bigoted, sexist, racist, ageist, fascistic,
        or intolerant will be removed from the group.</p> \\n<p>VEGAN FOOD &amp; DRINK:
        Even though you don't need to identify as vegan to be part of this group,
        we ask everyone to respect that we are meeting as vegans, so please ensure
        that you only eat vegan food and drink at our events.</p> \\n<p>PRIVACY: The
        right to privacy is a very important and fundamental human right and as such
        we ask that you respect other member's privacy. In this age of social media
        giants such as facebook, and other mega-sized internet monsters, there has
        been deliberately cultivated a culture of disrespecting and invading that
        right to privacy. Some people are very open about themselves and others are
        more private. Please therefore respect each other's choice and level of privacy,
        and try not to be offended if a person you are open to does not reciprocate,
        as that is their right.</p> \\n<p>OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA: The LGBT+ Vegans London
        meetup group is only on the meetup platform. We do not currently use any other
        social media such as facebook, whatsapp groups, instagram, twitter, etc. If
        we decide to use another social media platform then we will mention it here.
        If you come across or are contacted by anyone saying otherwise, then it is
        definitely not our group. Accept no imitations! We are the genuine leading
        queer vegan social group in London.</p> \\n<p>IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR AN EVENT;
        &amp; MARKETING/ADVERTISING: If you have a genuine idea for an event that
        may be of interest to the group then you are welcome to let us know. If it's
        suitable and one of our event organisers is interested in hosting the event
        then we will gladly make it a group event. If you want to send us information
        related to the marketing/advertising of a product or service then unfortunately
        we are unable to forward such information to our members. This is because
        Meetup has strict rules on sending marketing/advertising spam to members.
        Many members already complain about the number of legitimate messages they
        receive through Meetup, so it's important that we respect this and keep the
        number of messages to a minimum. If you have sent a message to the group's
        organisers then please be patient for a reply. Sometimes messages can be missed
        or overlooked, and if this has happened to you then please send another message
        to get our attention.</p> \\n<p>DONATIONS ARE WELCOME: We very much welcome
        voluntary donations from members to help contribute to the cost of using Meetup.
        Meetup charges a regular subscription fee for hosting a group, which is currently
        nearly £100 for six months including VAT, and depends on the exchange rate
        at the time of payment (the last six monthly payment was £97.72). If you are
        able to donate to help pay for these fees, no matter how small (or large!),
        then please get in touch. At the group's events we endeavour to ask attendees
        to voluntarily donate £1 or more if they are able to, although the amounts
        collected are currently not enough to pay for the group's fees.</p>\",\"created\":1348230450000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        only people who are actually going to RSVP and attend. Doesn\\u2019t matter
        if the numbers are good or great, if an organiser is booking space they can
        lose a venue\\u2019s support from too many no-shows. I\\u2019ve learned the
        hard way that it\\u2019s better to remove no-showers than indulge people who
        perennially get cold feet or can\\u2019t be bothered to change their attendance.

        group is for people who would like to take a gentle stroll in and around London.
        Walks will be of no more than 5 miles, and with no pressure to take a particular
        pace - if you want to stop we can stop, if you want to take it slower we can.</span>
        <br></p>\\n<p>This might be particularly suitable for people who are just
        starting out on a fitness regime, those recovering from illness or injury,
        but really it is for anyone who wants to take life gently!</p>\\n<p>I aim
        to put on one walk per month, more if I can manage it, and other organizers
        help out and lead walks for the Group from time to time so please remember
        to check who is leading the walk you are interested in. <br> <br> When possible
        we'll stop for a break at a pub or cafe (or a maybe a picnic in the summer).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As well as the walk itself, there'll be a chance to socialise with other walkers
        and get a chance to see a different part of London, or the surrounding counties.
        <br> <br> There's a £2 per person organizer fee, payable on the day for each
        walk - this helps me pay my regular fees to Meetup.com to keep the group going,
        and cover event organizer expenses. <br> <br> Visit our photos section to
        see some pictures from our walks so far.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing you

        is also open to those who live elsewhere in London or are new to the city
        as well as our good friends and neighbours from Europe. The majority of meetings
        will be arranged in and around East London, namely Hackney and the North East
        London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham, Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Havering
        &amp; Barking &amp; Dagenham and the City of London. Other Meetups may be
        arranged further afield, but unlike other groups, will take account of travel
        connections and disruptions on the East side of London. Meet ups will include
        pub meets (at gay &amp; straight venues), meals, exhibition visits, cinema
        and theatre meets. As well as other activities, including walks and visiting
        places of interest. Occasionally we might tag along with another Meetup Group.
        Where possible we will arrange meets that take account different budgets too.
        Members are welcome to make suggestions for Meetups, or host their one. They
        should contact one of the Groups organisers.&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p>Please note
        that our meet up notice board does not exist to provide free advertising for

        who are not coming.&nbsp; There is also a small £1 fee for the majority of

        there are circumstances where you prefer not to have a real photo and you
        may be asked about this.&nbsp; However, a real photo it is much preferred
        as it helps us all to relate to each other not to mention recognise others
        at events. &nbsp;Applicants who are anonymous, ie who do not provide any real
        details about themselves in their profile, will not be admitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We

        found to be engaging in this will be removed and may be blocked from re-joining.</p>\\n<p>In
        particular our Meetup group is NOT an online dating site. Random messages
        to other members within the group that you have not personally met WILL NOT
        BE TOLERATED.&nbsp; Any member reported to the group organisers for sending
        out messages to other members that they haven\\u2019t met for the purpose
        of&nbsp; \\u2018chatting them up\\u2019&nbsp; WILL BE REMOVED without warning
        and blocked from re-joining.&nbsp; Please note the Organisers will do their
        best to respond to member distress requests in a timely manner but please
        bear in mind all this activity is voluntary and they have many other calls
        on their time.</p>\\n<p>Members are expected to behave decently and considerately
        when they RSVP to events, communicate with other members and attend events.
        &nbsp;As you would with a group of your personal friends.</p>\\n<p><i><b>NO
        SHOW POLICY</b></i></p>\\n<p><i><b>North London Friends is run by volunteers

        &nbsp;Please DO NOT RSVP for events and No Show or cancel in the last 24 hours.
        &nbsp;Members who persist with such rude and inconsiderate behaviour will
        be removed from the group at the Organisers' discretion. &nbsp;As a general
        rule two No Shows and you are out on a third time. &nbsp;Or it could be sooner
        if it is a restaurant booking or similar reserved event and you did not cancel
        or attempt to get in touch. &nbsp;This may sound harsh but No Shows can spoil
        events and upset hosts and other members. &nbsp;Thank you for your attention.</b></i></p>\\n<p>Karen&nbsp;

        - For more events and information; <a>click here</a></p>\\n<p><span>WELCOME
        AND THANKS FOR VIEWING THIS GROUP!</span></p>\\n<p>Aim: The aim of this group
        is to truly offer an environment where people can build and develop <strong><span>quality
        friendships</span></strong> as well as those <span><strong>interested in relationship
        or social events.</strong></span></p>\\n<p><span><span>KEY PROBLEMS WITH OTHER
        MEETUP GROUPS?:</span></span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span> <strong><span>RANDOM
        PEOPLE</span></strong> <span>\\u2013 When you go to some of these Meetups,
        you meet some of the most random people with completely random qualities,
        attributes and interests. There is no filtering of the people that join.</span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>
        <strong><span>REGULARITY \\u2013</span></strong> <span>quality friendships
        require regularity of interaction. The major problem is that there are few
        Meetups with a regular crowd</span>.</p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>
        <strong><span>RSVP\\u2019ing</span></strong> <span>\\u2013 People seem to
        hate RSVP\\u2019ing to alot of Meetups. I feel that alot of people are not
        keen on the idea of meeting complete strangers and doing activities (like
        clubbing, going restaurants, going pub) that only close friends would normally
        do.</span></p>\\n<p><strong><span><span>SOLUTION:</span></span></strong></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>
        <span>To create an environment where people have certain traits, qualities
        and attributes in common</span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span> <span>To
        create an environment where the Meetup \\u2013 in this case \\u201csocial
        hobbies\\u201d \\u2013 automatically allows for participants to have a common
        interest</span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span> <span>The type of Social
        Hobby will be something regular (minimum once per week) which will allow for
        regular interactions that lead to QUALITY friendships.</span></p>\\n<p><strong><span><span>EXAMPLES
        OF SOCIAL HOBBIES:</span></span></strong></p>\\n<p><strong><span>- Speed Dating</span></strong>
        - Social event aimed at singles who are looking for someone</p>\\n<p><strong><span>-
        Lock and Key Parties</span></strong> - A less stigmatising way of meeting
        other singles and relaxing without the stigmatised pressure of speed dating</p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>
        <strong><span><span>GoMammoth \\u2013</span></span></strong> <span>Social
        sports leagues aimed at people that want to make friends. They do things like
        football, basketball, softball, rugby etc.</span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>
        <strong><span><span>City Academy \\u2013</span></span></strong> <span>They
        offer performing arts courses like Acting, Singing, Dancing, improv etc. A
        great way of having fun and bonding with other people. Another good thing
        is the Drama Workshop every Wednesday.</span></p>\\n<p><span><span>-</span></span>

        Badminton Club is a well established and friendly club. On Sundays we play
        competitive badminton using feathered shuttles over three courts between 13:30
        and 15:30</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Most of our players play in the league for
        other clubs and use this session for training and practice, as well as the
        social element. Sessions are competitive, fun, and often loud! We occasionally
        host tournaments and have training sessions. These are also organised through
        meetup. Please look out for these and sign up in the usual way. <br></p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>This
        is definitely not a club for beginners. If you have been playing for only
        a few years and need a recommendation then please ask. We would expect anyone
        wanting to join to have been playing for at least 5 years.<br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>If
        requesting to join please answer the question regarding how long you have
        been playing and at what level. If you don't answer we will message you to
        find this information out and won't approve you to the group until we are
        convinced that the standard will be right for you. As at January 2020 we are
        not actively searching for new members as our sessions are full at the moment,
        but may consider new members of league level and above. <br></p>\\n<p>We understand
        that sometimes plans change and we are fairly flexible with regards people
        dropping out of sessions they are signed up to, BUT we need to cover our costs
        and be fair to others on the waiting list who want to play. If you dropout
        after 11AM on the day of the session we would expect you to still pay the
        session fee as finding a replacement is not always possible. We believe this
        is quite reasonable and actually more accommodating than most clubs. Any no
        shows without even a message to me will result in an automatic ban, but this
        has never happened yet so please don't be the first. <br></p>\\n<p>We go to
        the pub afterwards. Typically this is either the Asparagus, or the Candlemaker.
        You will be welcome to join us of course. <br></p>\",\"created\":1422821942000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        you new in town and want to meet new people? Are you a seasoned Londoner who
        likes to meet people? Or perhaps you just want a little more adventure in
        your social life. If you are new in town and want to meet new people then
        London can be a little daunting. Even people who aren't new in town can often
        find it difficult to meet new people outside of their work friends. However,
        we all know that London and around it has so much to offer (particularly during
        the weekends) International group for Adventurers aim to organize a range
        of events from the fairly ordinary (perhaps just dining out, visiting some
        interesting events or walking with friends) to the quirky and adventurous
        trips in London and around it)</p>\\n<p>If you want a little more from life
        and would like to meet like minded people, then join International group for
        Adventurers! Top 5 reasons to join to our group:</p>\\n<p>* If you are new
        In town and would like to meet new people. &lt;br&gt;* If you are not new
        London, but would like a little more adventure from life. &lt;br&gt;* Would
        like the opportunity to try a range of interesting and adventure activities.
        &lt;br&gt;* You like a lot to travel and to visit different events &lt;br&gt;*
        None of the above but would like to improve your social network (e.g. drinks
        after work or dining out) The kind of meetups we aim to organize &lt;br&gt;*
        To discover new activities and places and to enjoy them &lt;br&gt;* Dining
        out or Picnic &lt;br&gt;* Walking in London and around of London. &lt;br&gt;*
        Events related activities and arts &lt;br&gt;* Travelling in the country.
        &lt;br&gt;* Pretty much anything that is fun to do with a group of friends.
        If there is something we aren't doing and you would like to try it, then just
        drop us a line and we will try to organise it. We just would to thou bring
        into our lives more freshness and variety!!!</p>\",\"created\":1467139373000,\"city\":\"Sutton\",\"untranslated_city\":\"Sutton\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        and wants to get out to meet a new partner and make new single friends along
        the way. It is difficult when all of your friends are in couples and your
        attached friends cannot come out with you at the weekend to a singles event
        if they don't wish to cause problems in their relationships. Coming out alone

        Behavioural Economic Network was first talked about by Oliver Payne and Leigh
        Caldwell towards the end of 2011, as a way of providing a place to bring together
        behavioural academics and practitioners; Towards the beginning of 2012, we
        were in our first home at the Salisbury pub. That year Oliver, Leigh, Nathalie
        Spencer, and Elina Halonen, put their heads together and settled on the overall
        name of London Behavioural Economics Network (LBEN). 2013 saw the move to
        the larger Sussex pub, and 'Ten Min Talks' speaking slots, and in 2014 a move
        to the more malleable space at the Tattershall Castle \\u2013 a large bar-boat

        is not run for profit and the numbers of attendees on each event is kept small.</p>\\n<p>Examples
        of event types: visiting galleries, concerts and festivals. Coach and train
        excursions out of London and weekend breaks. Trips to galleries and museums.

        <br></p>\\n<p><b>Who we are</b></p>\\n<p>A group of people dedicated and committed
        to making the great outdoors more accessible to everyone. With over <b>39,000
        members</b>, we have now&nbsp;<b>organised over 1,700 hiking trips</b> including
        day walks, weekend hiking trips and an increasing range of foreign hiking
        trips&nbsp;travelling to&nbsp;Europe and beyond for adventure travel holidays.
        We target ourselves at the 25 to 49 age group (or young at heart) and whilst
        most members are within this age group, we do welcome anyone over the age
        of 18 at any age and regularly have a couple of very fit people in their 60s.</p>\\n<p>Between
        our 3 most senior hike leaders we have over 50 years of experience of leading
        hikes across the UK as well as an ever increasing range of international trips
        and tours. We have every corner of the UK covered from Snowdonia in Wales
        to the Lake District, the great Scottish Highlands and even the far off corners
        like Cornwall.</p>\\n<p>Please do take a look at our (over 400) independent
        group reviews:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all\\\">http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all</a></p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/b/2/event_433336306.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>We
        have 47&nbsp;different day and weekend trips that have all been pre hiked
        and meticulously planned. We organise all the logistics for our hiking trips
        so that you can just turn up, walk and have a great time and meet new people
        while enjoying the great outdoors.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/6/event_433336358.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>If
        you enjoy hiking and are based in the UK, Outdooraholics is for you and we
        look forward to welcoming you to the group!</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Who
        attends our events?</b></p>\\n<p>We're mainly in our mid 20s to mid 40s, but
        age is no barrier as long as you are young at heart and over 18. In fact,
        one of our hike leaders is 67!</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/b/8/event_433336312.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>Most
        of our members generally either live or work in London, although we have people
        from all over the UK attending and we've had several people visit from abroad
        for our trips and join us at our destination. After all you don't need to
        live in London to visit Cornwall, Wales or the Lake District!</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/f/3/event_433336371.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>We
        have a lot of international members - either here on work placements or to
        live and this brings a superb cultural variety and mix of life experiences
        to the group and helps to make our trips so interesting and diverse.</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/2/event_433336146.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>We
        get a lot of people who attend their first event on their own and we always
        go out of our way to make everyone very welcome on our trips. They have proven
        to be a great way to meet people as well as to see this wonderful island</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/b/0/600_437192176.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>
        <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Can I really turn up alone?</b></p>\\n<p>Yes
        of course - most people do! Please don't be nervous about attending your first
        event - we have all been in the same boat at some point of turning up at an
        event alone and knowing nobody. To help introduce people to the group and
        indeed hiking we have designed 27 different hiking day trips which are a superb
        way to come and meet the group and we can assure you of a very warm welcome
        whatever event you choose and there are bound to be others who are attending
        their first event too. Hiking is a great way of meeting like minded people
        whilst keeping fit and seeing wonderful places too.</p>\\n<p>If you are nervous
        about committing to a weekend trip, please don't be, almost everyone has turned
        up to an event before without knowing anyone and we all know what it's like.
        To help new members into the group we run 4 to 6 day trips a month which are
        an easy and low cost way to try our events.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/d/event_433336157.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>What
        hiking trips do we organise?</b></p>\\n<p><b>Day hikes</b> <br> We organise
        typically 6 to 8 day hiking trips a month and have 27 tried and tested routes
        that we use from London. All are pre walked and are picturesque routes that
        we carefully choose. &nbsp;All trips leave from a central London station and
        we arrange train tickets, so you can just turn up and enjoy a great day out
        with us.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/4/9/event_433336201.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>Weekend
        hiking trips</b> <br> We organise 3 to 6 weekend trips a month to all corners
        of the UK, showing you the very best that this country has to offer. We typically
        rent an entire Youth Hostel just for our group and after a great days hiking
        then either go to a local restaurant or cook at the hostel. We have over 18
        different weekend trips and are adding new ones all the time!</p>\\n<p>We
        have a professionally trained chef who joins many of our trips and we regularly
        visit all of the UK's National Parks and designated \\\"Areas of Outstanding
        Natural Beauty\\\"</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/1/event_433336209.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>Trips
        abroad</b> <br> We offer an ever increasing variety of trips from 3 nights
        up to a week and will be having a number of new trips added in 2015. Where
        possible we aim for twin bed rooms and put the meticulous planning into our
        foreign trips so that you can have a great time and get to see the best of
        the area that you're visiting. It is a legal requirement (as well as advisable
        for safety) in many foreign mountainous locations to have an internationally
        qualified guide and for many of our foreign trips we have a local or native
        speaking guide.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/6/9/event_433336233.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><img

        <br></p>\\n<p>What else do we organise?</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Socials</b></p>\\n<p>As
        well as walking trips, we organise several pub socials per year in central
        London locations as well as discount nights at outdoor stores in central London.</p>\\n<p>We
        do focus on the outdoor events more than socials but we can recommend a good
        social group who do the following events:</p>\\n<p>Pub crawls, social events,
        wine tastings, sightseeing, making new friends, dining adventure, new in town
        drinks, food and cooking related events, exploring London's night life, social
        drinks, 18s, Go Ape, Treasure Hunts, Go Karting and Paintball</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Outdoor

        do we do it?</b></p>\\n<p>Quite simply - we all share a passion for the great
        outdoors and with all of our trip leaders being born and raised in the UK
        with a life long love of hiking, we can't wait to show you this great country!</p>\\n<p>We
        have so many wonderful experiences on our trips and many people have found
        a new love of the outdoors, met their partners through Outdooraholics and
        made what are likely to be lifelong friendships.</p>\\n<p>Our organisers can't
        wait to show you this great country and why we all developed such a lifelong
        love of hiking here all those decades ago</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/b/0/event_433336048.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>Yoga
        health and wellness retreats</b></p>\\n<p>We offer a range of superb value
        yoga retreats in the UK, which we call Yogaholics trips. We take your safety
        and the great reputation of our yoga/hiking trips very seriously and we only
        ever use professional full time yoga instructors. We also typically have a
        professional chef to ensure we have wonderful, healthy and revitalising food.
        We follow the same great formula as with our hiking weekends - great organisation,
        great home cooked food, pre planned and hiked routes and highly experienced
        hike leaders and using hostels allows us to do this at a great price too.
        We look forward to bringing you an even more expanded range of Yogaholics
        trips as we enter our 4th year of these Yogaholics trips in 2015!</p>\\n<p>We
        have created a great range of hostel based yoga trips on this wonderful concept,
        but if you would like more luxury hiking/yoga trips also run by a professional
        yoga instructor, we can highly recommend the excellent Yoga Trails:&nbsp;
        <br><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/yogatrails/\\\">http://www.meetup.com/yogatrails/</a>
        <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Why Outdooraholics?</b></p>\\n<p>A very good
        question. There are some superb London based walking groups on Meetup - Backabush
        are well known for over a decade of organising superb hiking weekends and
        brought the whole concept of great value hiking trips to Meetup and Trailblazer
        have been organising an excellent and huge range of days hikes for over 5
        years now. Both groups we highly recommend and regularly hear great things
        about their trips and both have inspired many other groups to offer similar
        events to theirs. 1000 Foot Hiking club is also highly recommended - run by
        some inspirational people on a non profit basis with all money raised going
        to a water aid charity.</p>\\n<p>Except for Outdooraholics most of the major
        London hiking groups on Meetup have evolved out of Backabush and Trailblazer
        and generally run the same format as their trips. Whilst we'd be lying if
        we said we weren't inspired by the great trips these groups run, we wanted
        to do something different and new and created Outdooraholics from scratch
        and we believe giving our trips a quite different flavour. We took a very
        simple idea as our basis - of organising all of the logistics for our hiking
        trips so that you don't have to. We advise you what to bring, you turn up
        and you'll have a great time. All of our trips are run by trip leaders from
        that particular country so we believe they can show you the country and culture
        like only a local can. We organise an equal mix of day hikes and weekend trips
        and put the same detailed planning into both.</p>\\n<p>We also try to use
        local tour guides for the majority of our trips so that you can get a proper
        insight in to the history, culture and country that you're visiting - after
        all you wouldn't expect to visit Russia for example and be \\\"shown\\\" the
        country and it's cultures by a British person!</p>\\n<p>We plan all of our
        trips in advance including the routes that we take to ensure that we show
        you the best of an area and also that we know what the risks are on the tracks
        and indeed that the trails are passable and safe. All of the photos on our
        trips are taken by one of our hike leaders, from that trip, on the paths that
        you will actually be hiking so that you can best decide which trips appeal
        to you. The great outdoors does carry risks which is why we pre walk and plan
        all of our routes and trips.</p>\\n<p>We believe we offer the most diverse
        range of both day hikes and weekend trips available in the UK.</p>\\n<p>We
        only offer superb trips and we even have a professional chef who joins us
        on many of our weekend trips to offer great food, which is much appreciated
        after a tough days hiking.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/7/4/event_433336244.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>Safety</b></p>\\n<p>Our
        main hike leader has undertaken both a four day <a href=\\\"http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/walking-group-leader-award\\\">Walk
        Group Leader</a> course accredited by the MLT (Mountain Leader Training) and
        a six day <a href=\\\"http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award\\\">Mountain
        Leader</a> course (also&nbsp;accredited&nbsp;by the MLT) as well as having
        a two day outdoor Activity First Aid course and over 20 years of extensive
        and diverse hiking and leading experience. All of our trips are run by very
        experienced hikers with Outdoor Activity First Aid qualifications and most
        of our trip leaders are a minimum of Mountain Leader trained with 2 of our
        trip leaders having a military background. Sadly the outdoors always presents

        anyone over the age of 18 who likes to build with Lego, no matter what their

        you are welcome to join us in having fun with Lego.</span></p>\\n<p><span>We
        get together on the second Monday of each month. Once upon a time, we used
        to meet in the function room of a pub near Euston station, but since the SARS-CoV-2
        virus came along, our Meetups have all been held via Zoom. Later in 2021,
        we hope to resume real-life meetups in central London but not until it's safe
        to do so.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\\n<p>Each monthly Meetup has a different theme,
        which usually involves building somethign with Lego, but sometimes learning
        about techniques&nbsp; or trading or even competitions. We try to keep it
        varied so there's something for everyone.</p>\\n<p><span>People - We attract
        all sorts of people from a wide range of backgrounds. We are about 60:40 male:female.
        Attendance usually numbers 40-50 people for pub meetups, and 25-30 for online
        meetups.</span>&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p><span>Age range - we have members in their
        late teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, with 30s being the median group -
        just.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>Photos - please upload a recognisable photo

        and welcome newcomers. Also, be aware members may take pics at Meetups and
        upload to one of our social media sites, so you need to be comfortable with
        a picture of yourself appearing online.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>Donations

        RSVP YES only if you wish to join us. We ask that members treat RSVPing to
        a meet up with the same level of commitment they would an arrangement to meet
        a friend. You would not just fail to turn up unless it was a major emergency.
        It's horrible and disheartening to be stood up and it may mean others on the
        wait list who want to come are prevented from doing so. Organisers and Event
        Hosts organise the group in their own time and the monthly website subscription
        fees are paid by the organiser.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>On this basis,
        if you do not attend a meet up without changing your rsvp to \\\"no\\\" &nbsp;and
        cancel at the last minute on two occasions your membership will be cancelled.
        Obviously, this excludes emergencies. We just ask you let us know in good
        time that you can't come.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>We encourage members
        to host events that they are interested in and we would be delighted to support
        you if you wish to host an event that interests you in an area/venue you're
        familiar with. Examples of events that members have run include cinema visits,
        basketball, art walks and walks in Epping Forest.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>We

        July 2020 and this group has been running for over 8 years, which is unbelievable!
        When our founder-organizer Lainie first set up this group she had just moved
        to South London and having lived either North or East for much of her life
        wanted to get to know the area and make new friends.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\\n<p>After
        7 years of moving from pub to pub and trying out loads of different venues
        we have finally found a home at the wonderful Selkirk in Tooting Broadway.
        However, on occasion we do sometimes meet in other South London venues - having
        crawled down the Northern Line we have scoped quite a few out!</p>\\n<p>Over
        the years we've read books that have become firm favorites, books to recommend
        to everyone&nbsp; (Middlesex, A Tale for the Time Being, Americanah to name
        just three) and we have read some truly terrible books that have led to heated
        debates and nights full of laughter and wine.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We keep a list
        of books that have been requested as future reads and regular members get
        a say in what we read next. This year has of course thrown us more than its
        fair share of challenges, including morphing into an online avatar and then
        back again, and we are proud to have been able to keep the home fires burning!&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>A
        shedload of thanks to our regulars, and a warm and hearty welcome to anyone
        who wishes to join and see what we are all about!</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<p>

        is a long standing and well connected group founded in 1997 and their meetings
        take place every first Tuesday each month. The group is affiliated with the
        famous Japan Society.</p>\\n<p>Having been a committee member in this group
        until my move to Munich, I am hoping to find as many enthusiasts about Japanese
        as well as German culture and language. Due to the connection with London,
        a bit of British angle also fell into the mix.</p>\\n<p>The idea behind this
        group is to bring together non-Japanese, who either speak Japanese or are
        serious about learning Japanese, and Japanese native speakers, who come together
        to converse in a pub/bar setting. It's all about learning, having fun and
        making new friends. Of course, everybody is welcome!</p>\\n<p>This meet-up
        is still under construction, but please feel free to join the club and we'll
        arrange the first event!</p>\\n<p>See you soon, <br>Ina</p>\",\"created\":1497464089000,\"city\":\"München\",\"untranslated_city\":\"München\",\"country\":\"DE\",\"localized_country_name\":\"Germany\",\"localized_location\":\"München,

        to have a fairly even gender split, but as the focus on single friends. We
        create an low pressure environment for meeting new people. The conversation
        is always great and the events are well organised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>One
        of the things I've noticed is what makes our events different everyone is

        somethings is a social club for people in their 20's and 30s. <br> <br> As
        well as organising afterwork drinks and clubbing nights, we often host cinema
        trips, bowling, meals, museum lates, day trips out of London, comedy and more.
        <br> <br> I have put together some FAQs below for anybody who is new to our
        group: <br> <br> Q: Is it weird for me to come along on my own? <br> A: Absolutely
        not. 99% of our members come along on their own. Sometimes a few people might
        know each other at an event, but this is only where they've met at one of
        our events before. <br> <br> Q: How does it work, do I just RSVP? <br> A:
        Yes! Just just RSVP and turn up. <br> <br> Q: How will I spot you if I don't
        know anyone? <br> A: The host will always let you know what they are wearing
        and where they are standing on the group page when they get there, so check
        the page regularly at the beginning of an event. If you really can't find
        us just pop a message on the group with a description of yourself and we will
        find you. <br> <br> Q: What is the atmosphere like? <br> A: It's not a clicky
        group. Everyone speaks to anyone and everyone. People are so friendly, never
        be afraid to join a conversation, people will always be very welcoming. <br>
        <br> Q: Why do people come to our events? <br> A: We have people from all
        walks of life at our meetups. People have different reasons for coming along.
        Some people have come over from a different country or area of the UK and
        don't know anyone. Some people have grown apart from their old friends and
        want to meet people with the same interests as them. Some people have finished
        Uni and no longer live near the friends they made. The list goes on, for whatever
        reason you come along I'm sure they'll be others in the same boat. <br> <br>
        Q: What if I don't like it when I turn up? <br> A: Most people love meetup,
        but if you feel uncomfortable you can slip out of an event at any time. <br>
        <br> Q: Can I host a meetup on the 20-35s Somethings page? <br> A: Yes you
        can. We ask that you don't host anything similar to what we already host though,
        such as drinks meetups or frisbee/anything close to the same date as another
        event, so that there's more variety. We also ask that you don't post events
        on our site if you plan on hosting the event on another meetup group as well;
        this is so that members are not misled about who will be attending the event.
        To host a meetup just click 'suggest a meetup' and fill in the description,
        including a date, time and location to meet. As a host you will be responsible
        for greeting members and answering any questions they post about the event.
        The organisers (Joanna and Anna) can guide you but you will ultimately take
        responsibility for your own event. That's just the nitty gritty bits - organising
        can be a lot of fun, you get to pick any place in London you fancy going to
        and meet loads of new people along the way! <br> <br> Hope to see you at an
        event soon!&nbsp;</p>\",\"created\":1303644790000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        eating out, love great conversation over delicious food \\u2013 but can\\u2019t
        quite bring yourself to shell out for a-la-carte 3 Michelin starred menus
        when there's so much great food already available for less?</p>\\n<p>Then
        we\\u2019re exactly what you\\u2019re looking for!</p>\\n<p><strong><em>BlackBelt
        Foodies</em></strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;group of friendly and talkative foodies,
        who meet to go to a variety of great places to eat! Places where the chefs,
        cooks and staff alike are passionate about what they make and serve it with
        a zeal. We will be trying at all sorts of restaurants, food adventures, supper
        clubs, street food stalls and pop ups - sampling all kinds of cuisines. From
        set menus to tea parties to Chinese, to pizza, to tasting menus to something
        completely eccentric \\u2013 we\\u2019ll try it all! And all without costing
        the earth! It won\\u2019t just be for dinner; sometimes we\\u2019ll meet up
        for brunches, sometimes we'll go to an event, sometimes we'll go out for cocktails,
        sometimes for a dessert hit, sometimes we\\u2019ll meet up just to try a cute
        new venue creating a buzz on social media, sometimes maybe we'll even take
        a trip abroad - relaxed and fun \\u2013 and hopefully, delicious! Week nights,
        week days, weekend -&nbsp;lunch, brunch or dinner - and possibly even the
        odd midnight feast! We're a friendly and welcoming group of people and we'd
        love to meet you.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><strong>Do we have any Meetup rules?
        </strong>While the anarchist in us despises endless arbitrary rules and red
        tape, we think it is important to set out some common ground so that we can
        all enjoy our meetups and minimise any embarrassment that could spoil an otherwise
        great meal out. </p>\\n<p>Our <em>8 Golden Rules</em> are simple and you are
        welcome to check with any organiser should you have any questions: </p>\\n<p>1.
        Have a clear profile pic of your face </p>\\n<p>2. Rsvp 'yes' and complete
        any payment in order to reserve&nbsp;your place </p>\\n<p>3. Payments are
        non refundable, unless the event is cancelled/rescheduled </p>\\n<p>4. Don't
        \\\"no-show\\\" or cancel without finding a replacement </p>\\n<p>5. Arrive
        a little early </p>\\n<p>6. No mobile phones unless taking pics </p>\\n<p>7.
        Respect restaurant service charges </p>\\n<p>8. Rude, disruptive or overbearing
        behaviour isn't tolerated - please don't be \\\"THAT guy\\\". </p>\\n<p> That's
        it!&nbsp;Nothing onerous. :-)</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><strong>Examples of
        where you'd go with us?</strong> Have a glance at our past meetups. Meets
        have included a trip to Paris, an exclusive deal just for the group at the
        OXO Tower, a trip to a bakery that ended up being an all day event, a fantastic
        meal with great views at the Duck &amp; Waffle, and set menu deals at places
        like the Winter Garden. And of course, lots of Sunday lunches...</p>\\n<p><strong>What
        sort of person comes to our meets?</strong> Every sort of person! The only
        thing we know we all have in common is that we love food and we all love to
        chat over a good meal. We've got members from all sorts of professions and
        all walks of life.&nbsp;London can be a tough place to meet new people (especially
        if you are new to London yourself). But don't worry about whether or not you'll
        fit in with us - if you're friendly and want to get to know people, of course
        you will!</p>\\n<p>So if you love to eat and you love to chat (at the same
        time, even!) then sign up to join us now! :)</p>\",\"created\":1337528023000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        London Stargazers\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/swl-stargazers/\",\"urlname\":\"swl-stargazers\",\"description\":\"<p>Instead
        of going out all lonely to see the stars and other things in space, let's
        share stargazing time and views for safer and more social, better experiences
        (and learn more)!</p>\\n<p><b>How</b></p>\\n<p>We do this locally in South
        West London (with occasional events elsewhere) and as often as the organiser's
        schedule/weather permits. Events may be at short notice (~2 days or less)
        sometimes if the skies suddenly clear. Hence our calendar can be somewhat
        random, but we try for at least one event per month, including: star-parties
        (in a public common/park), socials (pub/cafe), and occasional trips to exhibitions
        / observatories / other places of interest to astronomers. But no need to
        be an astronomer already - everyone welcome, from absolute novices to professionals
        and experts! (we're mostly amateurs and you won't be left out as a beginner).<br></p>\\n<p><span>We
        continue to meet in summer. For stargazing, we mostly start by meeting in
        lit public venues (</span><span>such as pubs)&nbsp;</span><span>near a darker
        location to gather and introduce ourselves; before walking to the darker location
        for viewing together. I aim to make events reasonably accessible via public
        transport too. This reduces worries for new members. Its much b</span><span>etter
        than expecting new members to find a small group of&nbsp;unknown people at&nbsp;night&nbsp;in
        hard to find&nbsp;dark places. Feel free to suggest new events/locations too!
        (always on the hunt for alternatives in new areas, might you have somewhere
        to share with us?)</span> <br></p>\\n<p>We enjoy sharing views through different
        telescopes/binoculars, or even with just your eyes; and knowledge about the
        planets/constellations/galaxies/deep sky objects and how to find them. Several
        members have telescopes and bring them to some meets, but you don't need anything
        to come along, just show up. Late evenings are much easier in Winter of course
        with earlier nights.</p>\\n<p>Its easy to find talks to go to around/near
        London to learn and the web always has plenty of news and info, so this meetup
        group is primarily for meeting up in the evenings to see the stars, the moon,
        planets or deep sky objects (if there are suitable telescopes around). <br></p>\\n<p><strong>When</strong></p>\\n<p><i>Note:
        </i>due to the weather, meetings may come up at relatively short notice or
        be cancelled if its terrible, but I plan on both weekdays and weekends, and
        try to set up at least one or two meets per month. I also copy over and post
        the Baker Street Irregular Astronomers group monthly (but irregular) events
        in Regents Park to publicise those as they are great events and usually very
        well attended (can be more than 100). Everyone from novices/beginners to&nbsp;experienced
        astronomers go, there can be 20-odd&nbsp;telescopes/binoculars on a good (clear)
        night brought by members, so they are a great way to learn more and see different
        equipment and accessories at work.</p>\\n<p>Some meets will fallback to a
        social evening inside if skies fail us. If a meeting is described (in title
        or main description) as tentative or unsure, then please check with the organiser
        whether it is still on, close to the day of the meet (by phone/text/email,
        allowing at least a couple of hours ideally in case of delayed response).
        Otherwise you take a slight risk going.</p>\\n<p>Use the message board to
        make random invites if you're planning a session a night or two ahead. It
        feels much safer and more fun sharing the wonders of the night sky with others.</p>\\n<p><b>Where</b>
        <br></p>\\n<p>Common meeting grounds might be Tooting Common, Streatham Common,
        sometimes Wimbledon Common or Blackheath, but we try others too occasionally.
        Commons/parks mean less streets and lights nearby, we choose the ones publicly
        accessible at night, and are generally the best places in London for stargazing.
        I'll try to keep public transport in mind as obviously dark skies tend to
        be further from public transport. You'd be surprised what you can see on a
        good night when away from immediate streetlights though, especially through
        any enhancing equipment (regular binoculars or even a pair of opera glasses
        will do, telescope even better).</p>\\n<p>For more about our regular locations,
        see the <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/swl-stargazers/pages/Locations/\\\">locations
        page I wrote about that</a> (in the \\\"Pages\\\" section on meetup website,
        not in the app).</p>\\n<p><b>Equipment</b></p>\\n<p>As I say, you don't need
        anything but your eyes to enjoy the night skies; there will almost always
        be at least some binoculars and a telescope brought along by others that will
        be happy to share views with you (the organiser has some good binoculars,
        often on a tripod, and a small telescope). But if you do have something you
        can bring - from as little as a red light torch (which doesn't ruin your natural
        night-vision so easily), to binoculars (any pair will do!), a camera (better
        if you can control the exposure manually eg. DSLR/bridge camera), or telescope,
        then we'd appreciate that and hope you can share views it gives. Even the
        star-map apps on phones are useful (eg. Google sky map, Stellarium) for finding
        targets to view. If you can provide transport for others to better viewing
        locations then thats also very much appreciated.</p>\\n<p>If you're interested
        in buying some equipment, do check out my <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/swl-stargazers/pages/Buying_advice_for_beginners_%28viewing_equipment%29/\\\">buying
        advice</a> in the page I wrote about that - but I very highly and strongly
        recommend you come to an event first (whether ours or another) and see other
        people's gear and ask questions first because it can easily be an expensive
        mistake if you don't know what you want, and even put you off for good. Or
        at least talk to someone in a proper astronomy shop (eg. Widescreen Centre
        in London, Astronomia in Godalming, or Tring, to name a few near/in London),
        and read a few reviews so you have a better idea what to expect. Things to
        consider: time to setup each night, weight/size to carry and put away, what
        you'll be looking at (planets/the moon? the sun? deep sky objects? everything?
        daytime use too?), ease of use (type of scope+finder, type/quality of mount,
        whether computerised/motorised), accessories you'll need/want (and cost of),
        and how well you know the sky or are willing to learn by hand all play a part
        - not just the cost and scope power!</p>\",\"created\":1310685102000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        Adventure</span></span></strong></p>\\n<p><strong><span>Join one of London\\u2019s
        biggest, friendliest and best organised groups for hiking, walking, travel,
        day trips, outdoor adventures and much more.</span></strong></p>\\n<p>Since
        August 2010 we\\u2019ve been organising a mixture of one day hikes and longer
        trips in the UK and abroad. We\\u2019re a relaxed and friendly group and our
        emphasis is very much on having fun and making new friends in an enjoyable
        environment away from all the stresses of the 9 to 5 in London.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019re
        a multinational group, full of active, friendly people mainly aged in their
        20s, 30s &amp; 40s. With over 19,000 members and regular hiking &amp; travelling
        events you\\u2019re sure to find something to your taste and to meet like-minded
        people.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019re a well organised group and try to do everything
        possible to make sure that you have a great time in an enjoyable, stress free
        environment. We organise all of the logistics for our trips so that all you
        need to do is to turn up and enjoy the trip!</p>\\n<p><strong><span>What we
        do</span></strong></p>\\n<p><span>Hiking \\u2013 day trips</span></p>\\n<p>We
        organise regular one day hikes near London (mostly on a Saturday). Typically
        we have groups of 30-40 people on our day hikes so you\\u2019re certain to
        meet like-minded people. Don\\u2019t worry if you\\u2019re new to hiking \\u2013
        we walk at an easy pace along public footpaths through beautiful but easy
        terrain in South East England. The emphasis is very much on enjoying the scenery
        and socialising \\u2013 we\\u2019re not a hardcore hiking group! The length
        of our hikes is 8-12 miles - depending on the time of year and how much daylight
        there is. All of our hikes have been pre-walked, so you can be sure that we\\u2019ll
        never get lost and will always walk along safe routes. Most of our day hikes
        start at train stations in Central London \\u2013 to join the hike you just
        need to sign up on line and pay using Paypal. The meeting time for all of
        our day hikes is at around 10am as we recognise that everyone likes to sleep
        a bit longer at the weekend! At the end of all our day hikes we always go
        to a village pub for some well earned food, drink and socialising.</p>\\n<p><span>Hiking
        &amp; sightseeing weekends</span></p>\\n<p>We organise weekend hiking and
        sightseeing trips to other parts of the UK throughout the year. Typically
        there are 20-40 people on our hiking weekends and we stay in hostel accommodation
        for 1/2 nights. Usually our trips involve one day of hiking and one day of
        sightseeing. We also book pubs for the group to eat, drink and socialise in
        after a long day of walking. As ever we put the emphasis on relaxing, having
        fun and meeting new people. The locations we travel to and our itineraries
        are as varied as the scenery of Britain. We\\u2019ve done hiking in the Cotswolds,
        along the cliff tops of the Jurassic Coast and up to the tops of the highest
        mountains in Wales &amp; Scotland. We\\u2019ve also done plenty of sightseeing
        \\u2013 visiting the historic city of Bath and its Roman baths, riding a steam
        train from Corfe Castle to the coastal resort of Swanage and walking along
        the spectacular coastal scenery of Fort William. There\\u2019s so much to
        see in the British Isles and we plan to see as much of it as possible.</p>\\n<p><span>Travel
        - Long weekends of sightseeing &amp; hiking in European destinations</span></p>\\n<p>We
        love to travel and thanks to budget airlines there\\u2019s a huge number of
        exciting destinations in Europe that we can go to for a long weekend. On our
        travels we like to see European cities and their surrounding countryside from
        a different perspective from that which tourists usually see them. Ian (the
        group organiser) has travelled extensively around Europe and has plenty of
        local knowledge to ensure a fun and eventful itinerary for all our trips at
        bargain prices. We also like to venture to the more unusual destinations,
        recently we have visited Moldova and Transdniestr, Ukraine, The Baltic States
        etc.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Typically our long weekends abroad have 25-40 people.
        We always stay in hotels \\u2013 usually sharing twin rooms but with the option
        to upgrade to a single room. Typically a 3 day weekend will consist of one
        day of hiking, one day of walking around and exploring the city and one day
        of doing something fun whilst we wait for our flights home. Our travels are
        planned in meticulous detail: we sort out the hotels, airport transfers, transport
        and entrance fees. We\\u2019ll also arrange restaurants and guide you around
        the local nightlife so that you can get the best possible experience at local
        prices. All you need to do is to book your flights then turn up and have a
        great time discovering a new city with a sociable group of people. Travelling
        has never been so easy!</p>\\n<p><span><strong>We look forward to meeting
        you soon on one of our hikes or on our travels across Europe.</strong></span></p>\\n<p><span><strong>Happy

        and performing in London for 5 years, and we keep growing. &lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p>\\u201cCastells\\u201d - or human tower building - is a Catalan tradition
        where groups or teams, called \\u201ccolles\\u201d, rehearse and compete to
        build towers as high and as complicated as possible. This tradition is nowadays
        international and there are over 100 official \\u201ccolles\\u201d. Castellers
        of London is the first group established in the UK.</p> \\n<p>We are a community
        group where everybody is welcome, and everyone has a role: big or small, short
        or tall, strong or even not so strong (like most of us!), there is a position
        right for you in a human tower. In any given tower, there are upwards of twenty
        people of all shapes and sizes - in performances, we build structures with
        eighty people or more. Our membership is very open and mixed: we have members
        aged five to seventy-five, and families are welcome too.</p> \\n<p>Our group
        is quite large: we have 30 to 40 members rehearsing weekly, and for performances
        we usually reach eighty or so.</p> \\n<p>Apart from building human towers
        in our performances and rehearsals, we also meet regularly for drinks at the
        pub, nights out, days at the park and outdoor adventures.</p> \\n<p>We rehearse
        twice a week: &lt;br&gt;- Wednesdays 7-9pm: at Guy\\u2019s Hospital (at Atrium
        1, Southwark wing), Great Maze Pond, London SE1 9RT &lt;br&gt;- Sundays 2-5pm:
        at the Thanet Youth &amp; Community Centre, Herbert Street, London NW5 4HD
        &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>Just pop in at any of our rehearsals and give it a go;

        * * *</p> \\n<p>During rehearsals, we practise a variety of structures - some
        with a view towards an eventual performance and others just for fun! At your
        first session, if you'd like to, you can expect to have the opportunity to
        learn how to safely and securely climb on the shoulders of someone and likewise
        how to support someone climbing on top of you, as well as learning in general
        how the structures we build work. Our learning curve is very gentle, and we
        take a \\\"safety first\\\" approach at all times - research in Catalonia
        on castells has suggested that it is considerably safer than other sports

        to the current situation&nbsp; we are only organising a limited range of online
        events, including french-english conversation, spanish-english conversation
        and english conversation evenings. These are all organised on Zoom. If you
        would like to find out more about these please email info@euroclub.co.uk</b></p>\\n<p>EuroClub
        organises language exchange meetings in London to practise speaking English,
        French, Spanish, Italian or German through conversation with native speakers.
        We are a friendly ,open and informal . The Club is organised by the members
        themselves . It is aimed at anyone who is interested in improving their language
        skills in the particular languages on which we focus and who is ready to help
        with and share their own language. Also great for meeting people, having fun
        and seeing more of London (and outside !). We currently organise regular language
        exchange meetings for French-English, Spanish-English and Italian-English
        . We talk for at least an hour in each language. We also have English conversation
        evenings where we only speak in English to allow you to have more speaking
        practice ! We meet up in pubs/bars where we usually have a reserved space
        or room for the group so that you are not surrounded by noise. The Club is
        open to anyone over the age of 18 from any country. Additionally we organise
        lessons tutored by qualified,experienced native teachers. We also organise
        lots of trips \\u2013 ranging from walks or museum visits to pub crawls or
        other social meetings and visits outside London. Often we get discounts if
        using a train to travel outside London through group travel arrangements.
        We are non profit making but because of our costs/expenses, we need to charge
        what we believe is a very good value membership at £12 pounds for six months
        if you are not working, or £20 pounds if you have a job. This allows you to
        come to as many meetings as you like for the 6 month period. Lessons tutored
        by qualified native speakers are only £3 pounds per session ! Come along and
        check us out! Anyone interested can come and try our language exchange evenings
        for free, while we also organise regular introductory chats about EuroClub
        over a coffee. Details of these are regularly posted on our website <a href=\\\"http://www.euroclub.co.uk\\\">www.euroclub.co.uk</a></p>\\n<p><br></p>\",\"created\":1365541389000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        year we organise:</strong></p>\\n<ul> \\n <p>\\u2022&nbsp;About 15 walking
        weekends away from London throughout the year, staying mainly in YHA accommodation
        or similar, all over England and Wales with the occasional trip abroad.</p>
        \\n <p>\\u2022&nbsp;About 20 day walks on Saturdays or Sundays throughout
        the year and occasional half day walks. These are usually in Hertfordshire,
        Buckinghamshire or Essex.&nbsp;</p> \\n <p>\\u2022 About 20 weekday evening
        walks, from April until early September. These are usually in north London
        or south Hertfordshire.</p> \\n <p>\\u2022 Social evenings on the 2nd Tuesday
        of each month at Discovery Hall, Netherlands Road, East Barnet, from 8-10pm,
        featuring guest speakers, barbecues, competitions etc. Pub evenings on the
        4th Tuesday. Contact us to find out which pub we will be in this month. Other
        events organised by members on an ad hoc basis, include cinema, theatre, restaurants
        etc.&nbsp;</p> \\n</ul>\\n<p>That's over 100 events each year! Once you are
        a member, you can participate in as many or as few as you like, it's entirely
        up to you.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our walks</strong></p>\\n<ul> \\n <p>We set a
        limit to numbers on Meetup to avoid having too many on a walk. On most day
        walks or evening walks, between 10 and 20 people attend, or occasionally up
        to about 25 on a popular walk. These include those who RSVP through Meetup
        and some annual members.&nbsp;</p>\\n <p>Our walks are arranged by a variety
        of group members, and are at a moderate to brisk pace. If you walk slowly,
        you will find it difficult to keep up. You may find that the Ramblers\\u2019
        health walks are more appropriate for you: <a href=\\\"https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/walkfinder\\\">https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/walkfinder</a>.
        All of our walks can (and usually do!) include muddy footpaths, even in the
        height of summer. You are therefore always advised to wear walking boots.
        Walks begin at the time stated and do not take into account bus or train arrival
        times. We do not check for, or respond to, requests for the start of any walk
        to be delayed. It is your responsibility to take delays into account when
        planning your journey and allow enough time to park and 'boot up'. Unless
        otherwise stated, it should be assumed that parking is on the road. Parking,
        as well as attendance on our walks, is always at your own risk.<br></p> \\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Annual
        membership</strong></p>\\n<p>Anyone can join our Meetup group free of charge,
        then you can attend THREE of our events (day/evening walks or Tuesday evening
        social meetings) free of charge (apart from any transport costs). If you book
        on a walk, and are unable to join us, please cancel your RSVP. This allows
        someone on the waitlist to join. If you do not cancel, the event may be counted
        as one of your three events.<br></p>\\n<p>After your 3 free events, you need
        to apply for annual membership if you wish to take part in further walks or
        other Group activities. You can continue to attend events while your membership
        application is pending. <br>Annual membership costs £24 for a full year from
        1st November 2018 to 31st October 2019 and is charged pro rata for your first
        year. Annual membership costs are halved for members under 18 or other concessions
        (see membership application from for details). This allows you to attend as
        many day/evening walks, weekends away or Tuesday evening social meetings as
        you like. <br> <br> <strong>Advantages of annual membership:</strong><strong><br></strong></p>\\n<ul>

        US</b></p>\\n<p>We are an established group of experienced hikers dedicated
        to enjoying the countryside for its fresh air, green spaces and the opportunity
        for socialising and fitness. Our hikes are usually around 10 miles or more
        in distance and include as many hills as we can pack in. Most hikes involve
        a picnic lunch (bring your own), and occasionally a pub lunch (for which we
        will pre-order). You are welcome to join us if you can maintain an energetic
        pace up hills for 4-5 hours. But, please read the Terms and conditions, before
        you join. This is a group for adults who are responsible for their own health
        and safety.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p><b>Terms and Conditions</b> <br></p>\\n<p>Our
        H2I Hill Fitness events require a moderate level of fitness but do not need
        the ability to run. All our hikes require a good fitness level. (As a guideline
        hikers should be in good health and already participate in regular 10 mile
        undulating walks or several hours of moderate cardio-vascular exercise each
        week). &nbsp;We reserve the right to exclude people who lack sufficient fitness
        (and thereby generate liability for the group), participants inappropriately
        dressed for the hiking environment or those who are disagreeable and diminish
        the enjoyment of the group. We will also exclude those who persistently \\u2018no
        show\\u2019 or cancel at the last minute, thereby preventing other keen participants
        from taking their place on the hike.</p>\\n<p>By signing up for one of our
        walks you have agreed that you have understood and will adhere to these terms
        and conditions.</p>\\n<p><b>&nbsp;Leadership and Organisation</b></p>\\n<p>Hike
        to Indulge has been going strong as a Meetup group since early 2011. Personal
        trainer and trekking devotee, Alex Murphy established the group as an alternative
        to exercise in the gym.&nbsp; By leading small groups on hilly brisk-paced
        hikes, participants could burn calories, work leg muscles, while discovering
        new places and people in the great outdoors. At the end of most hikes we visit
        local independent country pubs for post hike drinks and laughs. The idea is:
        hike hard to earn your right to indulge.</p>\\n<br>\",\"created\":1301409030000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        UPDATE - Happy new year everyone! Unfortunately due to government restrictions
        we are still unable to host in person events. We'd still very much like to
        provide the opportunity for people to meet, socialise and catch up so for
        the time being we will be hosting events online. Please keep an eye on the
        group for upcoming events :)&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>22/03 UPDATE - We have been asked
        by Meetup to not post anymore \\\"meeting in person\\\" events for the foreseeable
        future due to the COVID-19 outbreak. <br>We will resume usual events (pub
        trips, Sunday lunches, activities etc) when we're told it's sensible do so,
        which is likely after the social distancing measures have been lifted. <br>The
        1st event back will likely be a much-needed pub trip, however that could be,
        rather annoyingly, a few months away. <br>So I hope you all stay safe, and
        look forward to seeing everyone at a post-coronapocalypse event in the future!

        weekdays evenings. I am open to suggestions and happy to let members host
        their own events. Meet ups will be small approx 6-10 people, so people can
        easily get to know each other. Please feel free to use the discussion board
        if there something you would like to do or last minute meet up i.e \\\"anyone
        round tonight and fancy doing something\\\".&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span>PLEASE READ
        BELOW:</span> <br></p>\\n<p>I have ran events through a women's group in London,
        so I would just like to set some boundaries, expectations and clear purpose
        for group and how it will be run.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p>Purpose: fun,
        friendship, good times and happy vibes :-)&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p>Joining Requirements:
        Females only, with a clear first name and clear profile picture (i.e. a clear
        shot of your face, no sunglasses, no filters and just you in the photo). This
        is to make sure the host and others can recognise you at meetups :-). These
        will be reviewed regularly and people will be removed, if not meet.&nbsp;
        <br></p>\\n<p><span><span>Please note that this meet up is run for social
        purposes and done voluntary, and will be run stress and drama free. Organizers/Hosts
        have no responsibility for those who come to meet ups/events. Please make
        sure you read meet up details before RSVPing -&nbsp;</span>including<span>&nbsp;things
        like menus, you are happy with prices, you know how to get there, how to get
        home, can get home, you have the funds to pay, safe info, start &amp; finish
        times etc...all those kind of little things :-)&nbsp;</span></span></p>\\n<p><span><span>If
        you fancy hosting that would be fab but I would like to meet up with you first
        and have a chat on the phone to see how you would like to get </span>involved<span>&nbsp;etc...I
        will ask the hosts to make sure they are on time for there events, ensuing
        they introduce </span>themselves<span>&nbsp;and others, welcome and great
        all members when they arrive. However once a meet up has started I wouldn't
        expect&nbsp;organizers/hosts to check for messages/posts say after 20 mins
        of meet up start time (they are there to relax and enjoy </span>themselves<span>&nbsp;also).
        If you are going be late or cant get there on the start time let them know
        in good time :-).&nbsp;</span></span></p>\\n<p>Just a wee personal bit of
        info about me I work full time M-F office hours one job and I am also a personal
        trainer (I am busy little bee). So if I host meet ups these will be at the
        mo on a evenings, weekends, how often I really don't know. I will get back
        to joining requests/messages etc as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span>No
        fees for June/July - Lastly - from January there will be non refundable fee
        of £1.20 to each event.&nbsp; Meetup is a US app and when used in the UK you
        can only charge fees to events via paypal. Paypal also has fees, so the £1.20
        will also cover theses fees.&nbsp;</span><span>The fees will be non refundable

        group is for leisure cyclists who are looking for an adventure. It is for
        people who want to try out long distance cycling. Perhaps you have recently
        bought a bike and take it out for a spin few times a month or you are a regular
        user of Boris Bikes and want to try something more challenging, or else you
        may be a regular keen cyclist who wants to explore England on your bike. All
        are welcome to join.</p>\\n<p>A cycle route which goes around the Country
        (England), including a number of popular leisure routes on the National Cycle
        network (NCN) and goes past some interesting places, has been planned. The
        route starts from London (Thames Barrier) and ends in London. It goes around
        the Kent Coast line through Dover and Hastings to Brighton, it then comes
        back up to London and goes down the Thames valley to Bath and Bristol before
        going up north through Gloucester , Birmingham, and Manchester to the Lake
        District. The return path goes cross country over the well-known C2C cycle
        route in the peak district and then winds its way down the eastern coastline
        via York, Hull, Norwich and Ipswich. In short, it goes around the country.</p>\\n<p>The
        route is divided into 40 Segments. Each segment is between 40 to 60 miles,
        the total distance of the entire route is around 1300 miles. Each ride is
        expected to take between 4 to 6 hours of riding time, so that makes it a good
        day out. The objective is to cover this circuit over 4 summers..</p>\\n<p>In
        2013 we went around the South East Part of the Country from Thames Barrier
        through Kent and Sussex and then back to London</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/365066321\\\">http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/365066321</a></p>\\n<p>In
        2014 we will go around the South West Part of the Country, Starting in Windsor,
        down toward Southampton and back up to Bath, Bristol, Gloucester and then
        back from Swindon to Reading,</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/fullscreen/363952135/\\\">http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/fullscreen/363952135/</a></p>\\n<p>in
        2015 we will go North from Reading to Oxford, Birmingham, Manchester and back
        via Hull, Norwich, Ipswich back to London.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/fullscreen/365076095/\\\">http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/fullscreen/365076095/</a></p>\\n<p>Most
        rides that are close to London will be day trips, that is, we leave in the
        morning and come back the same day to sleep in our own beds. However as we
        go further away from London or get far up north they will become weekend trips
        with one ride on a Saturday and the second on a Sunday; some of these outings
        may also require a Friday evening start.</p>\\n<p>You can join to take part
        in one ride, a selection of rides, a section of the circuit or take up the
        challenge of completing the full circuit. You can start at any point and since
        it is a circle you can make any point the start and end point. If you decide
        to take up the challenge to do the whole circuit and can\\u2019t make some
        of the scheduled dates you will have the option to do a catch-up at a later
        date.</p>\\n<p>Typically, the rides will start between 10am and 11am. The
        starting point will be a train station. The recommended trains to take from
        London and other details will be posted as an event on the meet-up site, for
        each ride. The directions and the route information will be provided before
        the ride, the route will be easy to follow, people can choose to ride at their
        own pace, we expect to do an average of 8-10 miles an hour, and a 15-30 minute
        stop will be planned after every 10-15 miles. The idea of the ride is will
        not be to get from A to B, but to go around the country, enjoying the beautiful
        English countryside and taking in the sights</p>\\n<p>There will of course
        be a celebration at a pub at the end of each ride. The ride will end at a
        train station and people can make their way back home on the train.</p>\\n<p>To

        are we?</strong></span></span></p>\\n<p><span><span>We are a friendly and
        welcoming bunch of people with the primary aim to help goths meet and socialise
        with other goths in the London area.</span></span></p>\\n<p><span><span> <br>
        Our main interest is music and we often go to gigs and clubs. We run a range
        of different events such as walks, picnics and RPG nights. We attend festivals,
        go to the theatre, the cinema and art galleries, as well as organising the
        occasional pub social. We even have the odd trip to the seaside. <br> <br>
        Many of our members are native to London and know the scene well. Many of
        our members are also new to London. We have young members, old members and
        plenty of people who just enjoy being goth. Everyone gets out of the group
        what they put into it. <br> <br> We advertise other goth events and operate
        a discount scheme in conjunction with clubs and promoters to help support
        the existing goth scene in London. <br> <br> We are explicitly inclusive of
        anyone who falls under the broad banner of gothdom, regardless of gender,
        sexuality, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, faith or any other traditionally
        divisive factors. <br> <br> </span></span></p>\\n<p><span><strong><span><span>What
        are we not</span>?</span></strong></span></p>\\n<p>If you are expecting misery,
        moping, self-pity and think the world is against you personally, this is not
        the group for you. We are not better than you, but we're not a self-help group
        either.</p>\\n<p><span><span> <br> Contrary to some opinions we are not a
        horror, vampire, fetish, dressing up, modelling, photography, Satanic, heavy
        metal or architectural interest group. There are plenty of Meetup groups that
        are dedicated to those specific subjects, so if you're primarily interested
        in one of those, you're likely to be better catered for elsewhere. <br> <br>
        However, our members and organisers have an eclectic range of personal interests,
        which touch upon many of those topics. This means that we will occasionally
        go out to look at pretty buildings, hold meetups at goth-friendly fetish clubs
        or arrange to meet for beers at a metal festival. They just aren't the primary
        focus of the group. <br> <br> The primary focus is goth. Also, fun. <br> </span></span></p>\\n<p><span><span><strong><span>Still

        parties in cool bars followed by dancing or theme parties with dressing up,
        games and cocktails! Now during another lockdown we are going to run our Friday
        Nights In Online while we wait to return to face to face parties when its
        safe to do so.</p> \\n<p>Our group was based in Brighton plus members coming
        from all over Sussex and London but now as we go online we can welcome members
        from the whole world! We are all ages, all nationalities, any sexual orientation,
        singles and couples in this group.</p> \\n<p>Please don't feel shy about your
        first Meetup with us. Our organisers personally welcome everyone and introduce
        you to other members of the group, many are regulars and super lovely people!
        Our parties were in bars with reserved spaces, and meetup signs and orgznisers
        were in touch with members by text. Online we will also keep this personal
        approach. We want you to feel happy and enjoy spending time with us!</p> \\n<p>Please
        note that we ask for payments for Meetups as it covers costs and takes time
        to organise and promote events! Instructions for paying online by PayPal are
        on meetup pages as well as how to contact your organisers.</p> \\n<p>When
        we ran parties in pubs we negotiated discounts for clubs and drinks deals

        all street photographers!</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE STREET
        CLUB HAS GONE <b>VIRTUAL</b>!!! (thanks to Covid-19)</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>Welcome
        to <b>Street Club</b>, \\\"<b>London\\u2019s best street photography Meetup
        group,\\\"</b></p>\\n<p><b> <br></b></p>\\n<p><i>The first rule of Street
        Club, is to tell EVERYONE about Street Club!!!&nbsp;</i></p>\\n<p><i> <br></i></p>\\n<p>Join
        our awesome Meetups (usually in London - but now online) and hang out on day
        trips in the UK (when things get back to normal!). All levels are welcome
        and you don\\u2019t even need a camera as your phone will do the trick. Technical
        perfection is so last season, creativity is where it's at.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>This
        is super friendly community where the social side is as important as the photography.
        All Meetups are in mini workshop format based around exploring different street
        photography themes and and taking on creative challenges. Each begins with
        a briefing to give you inspiration as well as a focus for shooting, and (usuall)
        end in a pub with a chance to share your experiences on the street over a
        drink or just chat with other street photographers. *But while we are in a
        virtual format we get our social fix in a longer-than-usual briefing session
        online.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>But, ultimately while workshops are fun (I
        cannot deny it!) they are also about learning - IF you want them to be. So,
        once you complete some simple self-critique (guidelines on each event page)
        you will receive feedback on your work. Pretty cool huh?!&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>
        <br></p>\\n<p><b>Who am I?! </b>(asking for a friend)&nbsp;I am an Official
        Fujifilm X-Photographer, a former graphic designer and travel industry pro.
        I became a professional photographer in 2015; and my work has been exhibited
        all over the world and I also speak about street photography at events (such
        as the National Geographic Traveller Masterclasses) You can see my portfolio
        and also find out more about me on my website: <a href=\\\"http://pollyrusyn.com\\\">pollyrusyn.com</a></p>\\n<p>See

        on Thursdays</b>. The aim is to give people a place to sing their hearts out
        one or more evenings a week after work. LCV aims to bring people together
        to have some fun and make a great sound. <br></p>\\n<p>Have a look at our
        <a href=\\\"http://www.londoncityvoices.co.uk\\\">website</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/LondonCityVoices?notif_t=fbpage_admin\\\">Facebook
        page</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/londoncityvoice\\\">Twitter</a>
        for more information.</p>\\n<p>The main repertoire is drawn from contemporary
        pop and folk/traditional tunes. Some examples of what we sing:</p>\\n<p>\\\"Bohemian
        Rhapsody\\\" (Queen) <br>\\\"Mr Blue Sky\\\" (Electric Light Orchestra) <br>80s
        Pop Medley <br>80s Dance Medley <br>\\\"Break My Stride\\\" (Matthew Wilder)

        Day Like This\\u201d (Elbow) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p>Your first session
        is free, after that you can pay per week (£15), sign up for a term (£120)
        or a year (£300). Termly or yearly membership gives you the ability to come
        to any of the sessions (4 per week), so that is much better value for money.
        There are normally 13-14 sessions in a term plus a concert.</p>\\n<p><span>LCV
        has been running since the end of 2011, and for the first year it consisted
        of about 12 people meeting every week. In January 2013 we suddenly had 27
        members, and since then it hasn't dropped below that - we now regularly have
        more than 100 people at a City rehearsal. Our City membership is predominantly
        but not exclusively made up of people who work locally to Monument Station,
        and we always go to a pub after the rehearsal, where there is usually more
        singing (generally aided by the consumption of some Merlot). The Victoria
        branch is a little smaller, around 50 people. The Soho branch usually has
        around 90 attendees, again, we always go for a drink afterwards. Waterloo
        generally has around 80 in attendance and, once again, the pub is a necessity!</span><br></p>\\n<p>We
        hold at least two concerts a year, and lots of other events. Our concerts
        are usually at Troxy on Commercial Road. During December 2018 we raised over
        £10,000 for charity through our concert and various carol-singing activities.</p>\\n<p><b>It
        doesn't matter whether you are an experienced singer or you have never sung
        before</b> - there are <b>no auditions</b> and you don't have to read music
        (although we do provide copies of the sheet music for everyone). We usually
        record the parts and upload them to the website so that people can listen
        to them during the week. About 50% of the members can't read music but this
        is not a drawback. Occasionally if you are having trouble pitching, Richard
        may offer you a little help, perhaps before the rehearsal or at a mutually
        convenient time. We are firm believers that no one is \\\"tone-deaf\\\" -
        some people just haven't learnt how to pitch accurately yet.</p>\\n<p>We have
        had four weddings so far between people who met in the choir. Some very firm
        friendships (and indeed, at least 10 other long-term relationships) have emerged
        from LCV.&nbsp; <br> </p>\\n<p>You can find out more about the choir by going
        to our <a href=\\\"http://www.londoncityvoices.co.uk\\\">London City Voices
        website</a> - there are videos on the site as well as information about membership,
        pricing etc. You can also sign up to the mailing list <a href=\\\"http://eepurl.com/fPOmj\\\">here</a>,
        which will give you information about what we're up to.</p>\\n<p>Hope to see
        you at LCV soon. Do feel free to ask questions here or email us at info@londoncityvoices.co.uk.</p>\\n<p>

        to this Meetup group, for people who live in Luton, Dunstable and the surrounding
        areas, who\\u2019d like to take part in social activities on a regular basis,
        meet new friends and lead an active social life. <br> </p>\\n<p>Our typical
        members range in age from 20s to 60s, but there are no constraints on age
        (as long as you\\u2019re over 18)!</p>\\n<p> We aim to discover unique and
        unusual local activities and events, together with regular, more traditional
        Meetups like meals, theatre trips, live music and walks. Our aim is to create
        a balanced social calendar for single people and couples alike :-)</p>\\n<p>Most
        of our events take place in the three counties but sometimes we venture further
        afield to London. <br> <br> We\\u2019re always looking for new ideas, so please
        share with us your thoughts for future events. <br> <br> Previous Meetups
        have included a Mad Hatters Tea Party, a Ukulele Jam, a Butterfly Walk, a
        Narrow Boat Cruise and many more. <br> <br> To join this group, you must be
        easily recognisable from your profile photo. Please note we can\\u2019t accept
        photos from linked social media accounts if your face is not clearly visible.</p>\\n<p>We
        are asking members to make a voluntary membership contribution \\u2013 for
        example a couple of pounds per year - to cover the cost of having this group
        on the Meetup site. (Sadly it\\u2019s not a free service to the Organisers!)</p>\\n<p>This
        can be done by PayPal to a Money Pool we have set up for Meetup fees:&nbsp;<b><a
        href=\\\"http://paypal.me/pools/c/8g9m3pLy9A\\\">paypal.me/pools/c/8g9m3pLy9A</a>&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>...
        or in person when you attend an event. <br> <br> This group has an <b>Acceptable
        Behaviour Policy</b>. Please take a moment to familiarise yourself with it.
        The policy can be seen here:&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/Luton-UK/pages/28134063/Acceptable_behaviour_policy/\\\"><b>www.meetup.com/Luton-UK/pages/28134063/Acceptable_behaviour_policy/</b></a></p>\\n<p>In
        addition, we ask that all members keep in mind the fact that our Event Organisers
        are hosting their events completely voluntarily, in their own time and we
        need to make the events as straightforward as possible for them to run! The
        absolute basic requirement of all members is therefore to ensure that you
        keep your RSVPs up to date. If you put your name down to attend an event and
        later cannot make it, please either change your RSVP to \\u2018No\\u2019 ahead
        of the event or if the event has already started, write a comment in the event
        to let the host know you are no longer coming. Occasionally certain events
        where reservations have been made at venues will require a non-refundable
        deposit for this reason.</p>\\n<p> <br><b> Risk Disclaimer</b> <br> <br> Please
        note that all members take part in all activities solely at their own risk
        should any personal loss, accident, illness or physical injury occur during
        an event.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>Having trouble receiving our emails? Try

        everybody, My name is David. I recently moved to Miami from Denver. I've actually
        been living and traveling abroad the past 4/5 years, various spots in Spain

        some good people thus far in Miami through meetup, but I noticed there are
        no real meetups specifically in Downtown Miami (between AA Arena and the river),
        although I've met some people in this area via the bars, and with all the
        high rises I'm sure I'm not the only newbie. So this group is to see if there's
        any interest for people to get together once in awhile in the Downtown area,
        without having to go to Brickell, Wynwood, Midtown, or Sobe all the time.
        There's some laid back bars around Downtown that provide a good atmosphere
        to hangout and get to know people. This group is meant to be very laid back

        from our opponent with a real backgammon board and real dice sitting between
        us to play with. Fun and laughter followed along with the scrambling and spinning
        of dice with the occasional grumble of how lucky your opponent was at throwing
        their lucky dice rolls.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nowadays, people don't always find the
        time to play face to face and the unfortunate result is playing backgammon
        online in from of a screen and questioning whether the dice rolls are rigged
        or not.&nbsp; Sapphire Backgammon changes this, so why not come along to a
        warm and welcoming environment and play real people?\\\"</i> Chris S.<br></p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Hello,</p>\\n<p><i><b>Meetup
        fortnightly on Sundays at 3pm</b></i> <br></p>\\n<p><span>A very warm welcome
        to Backgammon Lovers and those inspiring to learn and improve their game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
        <br></p>\\n<p>Sapphire Backgammon held its very first Meetup in June 2015
        and we are coming up to our 130th Meetup in December 2019. Our membership
        is fast approaching 700 and rising. On average between 12 and 20 members attend
        our fortnightly meetups and last Winter we had our largest turnout of 29 backgammon
        lovers. <br></p>\\n<p><span>This is an established group for backgammon players
        of all standards - from beginners to champions, it really doesn't matter what
        level you are or how competitive or not that you choose to be - we have quite
        a selection of players, both men and women, from diverse backgrounds across
        the globe.</span></p>\\n<p><span>My aim is to have a laid back sociable afternoon
        that drifts into the evening with people who want to play backgammon in a
        friendly and welcoming environment.&nbsp; We sometimes have fun tournaments
        with small prizes for those with a slight competitive edge.&nbsp; I&nbsp;
        recently learnt how to play with the doubling cube - that mysterious object
        on the side of some boards.</span></p>\\n<p><span>We currently meet at VQ
        Euston - right next to one of Euston Square underground exits, and two minutes
        from Euston Warren Street underground stations where there is usually free
        parking&nbsp; available on Sundays on the accessible streets nearby. The staff
        </span><i>at VQ - Ewa, Gabbie, George, and others - are really warm and welcoming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br></p>\\n<p><i>Please
        bring your own&nbsp; backgammon board</i><span>, however, both I and others
        should have our own, and I do sometimes carry a spare or two -&nbsp; we simply
        need one board between two players.&nbsp; We are always delighted to play
        on different boards that are different in size, style, feel and price and
        to meet the players behind their boards.</span></p>\\n<p>I will ask for £2
        that helps me pay Meetup (yes Meetup sadly isn't free for Organisers and I
        pay a handsome six-monthly subscription fee) and this covers other admin costs.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span>We
        look forward to meeting and playing this enjoyable game with you soon.</span>

        a friendly group of adult men and women of all ages and from all walks of
        life, some of whom work, study or live in East London but many who don't.
        Our ages range from early twenties to late forties but we accept (and have)
        adult members of all ages.</p>\\n<p>As well as encouraging reading, it's a
        fantastic way to meet people and our meetings are great fun!</p>\\n<p>We meet
        in the East Village, Stratford each month to catch-up and discuss books. The
        discussion is quite lively and we have a great deal of fun!</p>\\n<p><span>The
        COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we do things but it reminds us how much
        we all still need, as the sociologist Ray Oldenburg put it, a <a href=\\\"https://www.pps.org/article/roldenburg\\\">\\\"third
        space\\\"</a> given that, for many of us, our first and second spaces (home
        and work) essentially merged in 2020.</span><br></p>\\n<p><span>Although Zoom,
        Microsoft Teams and other video-conferencing services have been invaluable
        for many, \\\"Zoom fatigue\\\" is real as is social isolation as a consequence
        of long-term working from home (or, if you prefer, \\\"living at work\\\").
        Therefore, we have chosen to remain an <a href=\\\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/irl\\\">IRL</a>
        book club and not become a virtual one.</span></p>\\n<p>Stratford Book Club
        follows current applicable regulations and guidance to protect members and
        the public from COVID-19. In other words, until herd immunity for COVID-19
        has been achieved in the UK through an effective vaccine:</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        We will look to meet in external venues;</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Social distancing
        must be observed at our events; <br></p>\\n<p>\\u2022 Anyone with symptoms
        of COVID-19 or who may have been in recent contact with anyone with COVID-19
        should not attend our meetings; <br></p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Face masks are
        permitted; and <br></p>\\n<p>\\u2022 Close physical contact, e.g. handshakes
        or hugs should be avoided. <br></p>\\n<p>You can see what we've previously

        Lingo is a sociable and free new way for locals and internationals to meet
        and practice languages or just make friends as much with locals as tourists.</p>\\n<p>Singapore
        currently has one weekly event: <br>\\u2022 Every Thursday at kult kafe -
        from 7pm</p>\\n<p>All nationalities and ages | <br>Our aim is to bring the
        international communities in closer to the local community. Meet people from
        all kinds of amazing backgrounds speaking all sorts of different languages
        from all over the world. There are no limits and nobody is exempt. We get
        together for good conversation, to make friends and have a nice time.</p>\\n<p>How
        does it work? | <br>Guests are given flag-stickers to stick on their chest.
        These flags represent the languages the guest speaks and go in order of fluency
        from strongest at the top to weakest at the bottom - Easy!</p>\\n<p>We have
        one suggestion | <br>\\\"Stay standing and only sit down for a private conversation\\\".
        <br>Why? Because if you stand it's easier for people to catch your eye and
        come and talk to you, and visa versa. It allows people to move and flow from
        group to group in a way you just can't achieve sitting down.</p>\\n<p>How
        many people go? | <br>In Singapore we expect around 200 people per event.
        <br>Most participants are not members of MeetUp so don't be put off if numbers
        are low here, we're a well established event.</p>\\n<p>People look young and
        pretty in the photos, am I too old?| <br>Nah! We just have really good photographers.
        This event is for all ages. The majority are 25 to 45 but we get plenty of
        people from outside those parameters too.</p>\\n<p>Around Asia and the world
        | <br>Visit us in Bangkok, Saigon, Yangon, Chiang Mai, Nanjing + more other
        Asian cities. We're also in 27 cities around the world including Rio De Janeiro,
        New York, Toronto, Lisbon, London and Melbourne + many more. Check our website

        are a safe and friendly social environment for bisexual, pansexual, polysexual,
        queer, fluid or similarly non-monosexual people (aka. m-spec, bi+). Partners,
        allies, and supportive curious people also welcome - don't direct biphobia
        at us. Come make bi+ friends, hang out, chat, and feel part of a community
        in a free-to-attend, casual informal environment.</p> \\n<p>What do we do?
        We've always had our monthly pub drinks evening in Soho on the same fourth
        Thursday, which are pretty balanced for gender/ethnicity. During quarantine
        these run online (via Zoom), link in the event description and as the event
        location. We also now have a Discord server under the group's name. &lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p>Sometimes we've run clubbing nights, but you'll also see regular culture
        events (usually run by others but listed here also for us to go to as a group)
        - eg. cabaret/comedy/plays, in summer we do picnics and walks too, and of
        course the big yearly/national events like Bicon and local Pride festivals
        and parades (6 in 2019 including London, Croydon, Black Pride and Trans Pride).
        You'll see events from other bi community groups with regular meetings too,
        that otherwise people might not discover - eg. the Bi Underground, Bi Coffee,
        and Opening Doors' Bi the Way meets, or the Bi Pandas activism-focussed events.</p>
        \\n<p>In 2019 we were the largest bi group in London's Pride (had capacity
        to be one of the top-10 sized groups in the whole parade), and crowdfunded
        to make huge (5 metre) bi and pansexual pride flags. The organiser John is
        also the source of the well-loved bi, and now also trans, <a href=\\\"https://londonbisexualsmeetup.sumup.link/product/5424dd1c-d98c-4fca-a745-4f1674d2fcb9\\\">pride

        <b>Diversity and Inclusion</b></p> \\n<p>People of all abilities, religions,
        sexualities, ethnicities and genders welcome as long as you respect other
        members and their identities. Some regular events require ability to use stairs
        and will have background music/noise. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p><b>Rules</b></p> \\n<p>\\u2022 <b>Keep your main profile picture for
        this group 'family-friendly'</b> or you will be removed or (for repeated/unfixed
        offences) banned; we are not a swingers or nudists group. You get one warning
        ever. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>\\u2022 Don't be a dick! ie. Respect others, and
        especially their privacy, at all times. eg. get permission for photos, and
        what you'll do with them; don't \\\"out\\\" anyone without permission; try
        to assume good intent, and you don't know what (else) is going on in people's
        lives. Disabilities are not always visible/obvious.</p> \\n<p>\\u2022 Abuse
        at events or via Meetup messages/actions will not be tolerated (organisers
        may need to be notified, they cannot see your private messages). Infractions
        will lead to the perpetrator's removal from the event+group, possibly a ban;
        reports presumed honest. Trivial first instances (level decided by target
        of abuse or representative if available) may be warned instead. Meetup also
        has ways to report users in messages or via profiles. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p><b>Events</b></p> \\n<p>The vast majority of our events are social informal
        chat evenings, the main one with an 18+ age limit in a bar (during lockdown
        online instead, without age limit). Several others are regular events from
        us or shared here from other London bi community groups, or one-offs by other
        activists and venues (occasionally commercial). As a member you're welcome
        to suggest social events too (but don't spam commercial events to us especially
        if only partly relevant, or we'll ban you and your post won't survive long).
        If so, either you can run them or an organiser may help (if they have the
        time/motivation); best if you have previously attended other (of our own)
        events, so you can gauge the atmosphere and expectations. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>We
        also publicise, attend, and even work on, the largest local/national bi events
        and prides like Bicon, Pride in London's yearly parade, London BiFest, Croydon
        and other local Prides. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>There have occasionally been
        outings to 'alternative'/sex-positive events - eg. a couple of fetish club
        visits, transgender club nights, even pancake restaurants - shock! These are
        rare though; if they're not your thing, ignore them. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>Turnout
        is strong (reliably 40 or more for the in-person monthly bar socials, usually
        10-30ish for most other official meets).</p> \\n<p>ALWAYS many new faces at
        <i>every</i> meet alongside the regulars. We also post regular community events
        run by other London bi groups (we usually add \\\"[other group]\\\" to the
        title) to publicise them, or for relevant external events (BiCon, Pride etc.),
        and as a member you can suggest your own event ideas for us or tell us of
        relevant events we should check out (but don't spam us/promote commercial
        media events without checking with organisers first).</p> \\n<p>Remember -
        80% of getting anything out of being a member is about showing up and taking
        part, so turn up to a few events (or create an event if you want more variety
        - anything social, others/the organiser may help plan/run it). You're sure
        to have fun! No need to be nervous, its a regular social group. <b>If you
        have a commercial event</b> to advertise - talk to me first (organiser John).
        Spam <i>not</i> tolerated - we'll block &amp; remove everything asap. <b>If
        you're a show/study researcher wanting people</b>, <a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/london-bisexuals/messages/boards/view/addpost?forum=678207&amp;parent=130534917\\\">reply
        to the message board thread</a> for that (keep it on that thread, anything
        else discuss with the organiser) / post to our <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/londonbimeetup\\\">FB
        page</a> / ask. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>If you love us and stay - we're free
        (I pay the meetup fees out of my own pocket), but happy to accept donations
        to cover meetup costs at our <a href=\\\"https://ko-fi.com/londonbimeetup\\\">ko-fi</a>
        page.</p> \\n<p><b>Get a star!</b> Some members have star(s) '★' or black
        mark '∎' under their name (in their title), this is to celebrate our best
        contributing members (stars for members who've run great events/already an
        activist/been a long-term reliable and frequent attendee, 2 for organisers
        past/present); or to hint (with a black (square) mark) that a failure to respect
        the group - eg. not turning up for a ticketed event without letting us know
        or apologies, and shouldn't be relied on as much. Black marked members will
        not have guaranteed space at any ticketed event until they redeem themselves
        (getting the mark removed) by showing up enough, and might not be trusted
        to run events. Starred members are awesome, generally reliable people and
        have helped us all lots (even if from outside the group)! Support/attend their

        In The Pub - Philly\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/Philly-Skeptics/\",\"urlname\":\"Philly-Skeptics\",\"description\":\"<p>\\\"Skeptics
        In The Pub\\\" started in London in 1999 as an informal social event designed
        to promote fellowship and social networking among scientific skeptics, free
        thinkers, rationalists, science enthusiasts, and other kindred spirits. The
        group is now held in various forms around the world, with well over a hundred
        local chapters.</p>\\n<p>The Philadelphia chapter of \\\"Skeptics in the Pub\\\"
        hosts bi-weekly group discussions on a range of topics related to science
        and rationality. There's several things that set our group apart from many
        other skeptic groups out there:</p>\\n<p>(1) While most Skeptics in the Pub
        chapters rely on guest lecturers, we're primarily an intellectual discussion
        group. That means that our regular bi-weekly meetups have a discussion topic
        and require some preparation and involve active participation.</p>\\n<p>(2)
        Most other chapters of Skeptics in the Pub host their events in \\\"pubs\\\"
        as the name suggests, but we typically host our small group discussions in
        cafes &amp; other quiet areas so that noise levels don't interfere.</p>\\n<p>However,
        if you're into beers &amp; bars, fear not! We also regularly attend several
        monthly science-related events in Philadelphia where drinks are served, such
        as \\\"Science on Tap\\\", \\\"Nerd Nite\\\" and \\\"Profs &amp; Pints\\\".
        We also occasionally hold informal socializing events for our members called
        \\\"Drinking Skeptically\\\". These events tend to be more social &amp; require
        less preparation from participants, so if you're looking to just have fun
        &amp; meet people while learning something new, these events may be for you.
        (NOTE: During the COVID epidemic, most of these events have moved online.)</p>\\n<p>(3)
        When it comes to addressing pseudoscience &amp; the paranormal, we tend to
        address controversies among serious scientists &amp; scholars that aren't
        clear cut rather than just debunking fringe beliefs like homeopathy, Flat
        Earth, Bigfoot, ghosts &amp; alien abductions for the hundredth time. We typically
        only address pseudo-scientific beliefs once they become widespread enough
        to cause major risks or interfere with major benefits to society (e.g. the
        anti-vaccine, anti-GMO, anti-nuclear power, and climate change denial movements).</p>\\n<p>(4)
        While we champion the scientific approach to empirical questions, we're careful
        to avoid a common pitfall of some skeptic groups -- i.e. \\\"scientism\\\"
        -- the application of science to non-empirical questions in fields like ethics
        &amp; aesthetics. Also, while we generally defer to the scientific establishment,
        we also occasionally act as critics when it comes to issues like funding biases,
        academic fraud, and the replication crisis.</p>\\n<p>(5) When we cover conspiracy
        theories, we tend to focus less on bizarre beliefs about \\\"Men in Black\\\"
        and the \\\"Illuminati\\\" in favor of somewhat more plausible allegations
        of political corruption, corporate malfeasance, police cover-ups, covert military
        actions, domestic spying, etc. We also look at how low science literacy &amp;
        internet echo chambers lead many normal people to go beyond realistic concerns
        about Big Government &amp; Big Business and embrace irrational conspiracy
        theories.</p>\\n<p>(6) When we address problems with the news media, instead
        of debunking obvious hoaxes from junk tabloids &amp; \\\"fake news\\\" websites,
        we tend to focus on problems within the mainstream media coverage, such as
        the exagerration of scientific findings in \\\"pop science\\\" journalism,
        product ads masquerading as articles, and the fear-mongering that drives \\\"moral
        panics\\\".</p>\\n<p>(7) Although we occasionally address political issues,
        we do so from a non-partisan, empirical approach. Any politician, pundit or
        political party that makes claims that are unsupported by logic &amp; evidence
        are open for criticism.</p>\\n<p>(8) While most skeptic groups double as atheist
        groups, this meetup doesn't require members to have any particular position
        on abstract metaphysical questions like the existence or non-existence of
        a \\\"higher power\\u201d, whether or not free will &amp; our sense of self
        are \\\"illusions\\\", whether or not we're living in a simulation or a multiverse,
        etc. When we cover religious issues, rather than debating the existence of
        God or creationism vs evolution for the thousandth time, we often focus on
        topics related to the psychology &amp; sociology of religion.</p>\\n<p>(9)
        Many skeptics groups focus on topics raised by a relatively narrow circle
        of science communicators at skeptic organizations like James Randi's JREF,
        Michael Shermer's Skeptic Magazine, the Richard Dawkins Foundation, the Centre
        for Inquiry (CFI), and Steven Novella's SGU podcast. We cover their material,
        but we also draw material from adjacent communities like the \\\"New Atheist\\\"
        movement &amp; its overlap with the emerging \\\"Intellectual Dark Web\\\"
        (esp. Sam Harris, Steven Pinker, and Bret &amp; Eric Weinstein), the \\\"rationalist\\\"
        blogosphere (esp. Less Wrong, SlateStarCodex &amp; Rationally Speaking), Jon
        &amp; Hank Green's \\\"Nerdfighters\\\" movement, and the broader community
        of science journalists at media outlets like Discovery &amp; Scientific American
        and skeptic &amp; science-related YouTube channels (e.g. Adam Ruins Everything,
        Veritasium, Rationality Rules, Cosmic Skeptic, Genetically Modified Skeptic).</p>\\n<p>If
        this sounds interesting to you, we hope you'll join us!</p>\",\"created\":1391364680000,\"city\":\"Philadelphia\",\"untranslated_city\":\"Philadelphia\",\"country\":\"US\",\"localized_country_name\":\"USA\",\"localized_location\":\"Philadelphia,

        <br> <br>6) To provide access to written material on Wicca that is written
        from the perspective of those practicing in a coven setting to ensure that
        new members understand how experienced Wiccans practice. <br> <br>The group
        provides a straightforward access point to the Wiccan tradition and we are
        dedicated to facilitating access to initiatory coven Wicca for all seekers.
        <br> <br>Our Order website is below <br> <br><a href=\\\"http://ootham.wordpress.com/\\\">http://ootham.wordpress.com</a>
        <br> <br>We also run a major Wicca website at <br> <br><a href=\\\"http://www.wicca.org.uk/\\\">http://www.wicca.org.uk</a>
        <br> <br>The Wiccan Federation and its associated covens also hold a number
        of events not on meetup which are for the members associated with the covens.
        Although the covens are spiritual groups they are also groups of friends and
        hold their own gatherings. <br> <br>We try to avoid bringing members to events
        in private houses who are unknown to our network unless they are with a friend
        we know. Additionally we are a group for Wiccans. Our focus is on those seeking
        to join the Wiccan path. <br> <br>The group is also limited to the over 21s.
        We have special arrangements for those who are 20.</p>\",\"created\":1392676041000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        to the current situation we are only organising a limited range of online
        events, including french-english conversation and english conversation evenings.
        These are all organised on Zoom. If you would like to find out more about
        these please email info@euroclub.co.uk for details.</span><br></b></p>\\n<p><span>Are
        you looking for speaking practice in English or French with native speakers
        ?&nbsp;</span><br></p>\\n<p> Are you new to London ? <br> Would you like to
        meet new people ? <br> Then EuroClub French-English exchanges could be perfect
        for you. <br> EuroClub has been organising French-English language exchanges
        in London since 2005. We speak French from 7pm until just after 8pm and then
        in English so that there is plenty of time for each language. <br> It's a
        great opportunity to develop your spoken language skills in French or English
        through conversation with native speakers in friendly groups in a pleasant
        location. You can also contribute by helping others with your native language.
        We meet every Thursday evening from 7pm in Central London. Usually we meet
        in the Farringdon/Clerkenwell area where we have a reserved room upstairs
        in a lovely pub. The language exchange meetings are not classes though our
        members are supportive and helpful so that you can feel comfortable in gaining
        more experience in speaking and listening. They are not suitable for complete
        beginners as you will speak at a conversational level (any queries to david@euroclub.co.uk)
        <br> We also provide tutored classes on other days in French and English with
        qualified, experienced teachers in a relaxed environment. However at present
        we do not have complete beginners classes. EuroClub also organises english
        conversation evenings and language exchanges in Spanish-English , Italian-English
        and German-English so that members have access to a variety of opportunities
        for speaking practice with native speakers.</p>\\n<p>We also organise walks,
        outings, visits to museums etc. so that members can take part in a variety
        of activities together and enjoy London. We are non-profit making and the
        club is run by its members for their own benefit. <br> It is free to come
        and try a meeting before joining. Six months' membership costs only £12 if
        you are not working or £20 if you are working. We can sometimes negotiate
        a reduced cost for someone who is in London for a short stay. It is free to
        come and try a meeting before joining. <br> Though we have a Club membership
        we are open in our approach and our Facebook group is at <a class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://www.facebook</a>....

        &amp; overseas members too)</p> \\n</ul>\\n<ul> \\n <p><strong>Frequent &amp;
        varied events in Central &amp; West London</strong>; debates, talks ranging
        from social issues to science, lectures, friendly pub meetups, exhibitions,
        picnics ...free speech is <strong>never censored or hindered (we recognise
        the difference between being against ideas or people!). CELEBRATIONS are also
        an important</strong> feature of the group.</p> \\n</ul>\\n<ul> \\n <p><strong>We
        explore serious issues (but embrace an unashamedly playful side, too)</strong>
        Our maxim: Humour often reaches where lectures don\\u2019t!</p> \\n</ul>\\n<ul>
        \\n <p><strong>Open debate - no censoring!</strong> Anywhere, forums, events.
        We're against censoring in any form for adults. Expect civil (no personal
        comments), friendly, AND frank. <br></p> \\n</ul>\\n<ul> \\n <p><strong>A
        peaceful activist platform (</strong>for those who want it - no pressure).
        We don't advocate 'forcing' atheism (it's an inevitable conclusion of thinking
        critically anyway!), we just want people to be ALLOWED to think for themselves,
        especially children. No violence/aggression, obviously, but no need for timidity
        either. Reason, critical thinking &amp; egalitarianism are values to be promoted
        &amp; celebrated - &amp; we're confident, forthright and committed. We don't
        accept the term 'militant' - no militia is ever involved ;-) ...besides, atheism
        cures religious terrorism ;-)),</p> \\n</ul>\\n<p><span>We facilitate &amp;
        support (N</span><span>O 'IMPOSING'!) doing *something* - whatever is right
        for YOU</span><span>, your circumstances, disposition etc ...even if it's
        'just' silent membershi</span><span>p, or social only. Just by joining the
        group,</span> <span>you're already an activist because</span> <span>you add
        to our weight to speak for those who can't help themselves, so thank you.

        a tutti!</p>\\n<p>This is a relaxed and friendly group always open to new
        members who can speak in Italian (<b>we are not a beginners group</b>). At
        the moment we always meet at least twice a month. Once a month at a pub in
        central London during the week and once at a month for an aperitivo at the
        weekend, usually at an italian bar or restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We also usually
        have other events during the month which can include picnics, cinema nights,
        walks, wine tasting, quizzes, reading nights, big national football matches
        or visits to the theatre.</p>\\n<p>The meetups are fun, very sociable and
        everyone is welcome as long as they speak an intermediate level of Italian.
        However this is not a meet up where you can learn italian, that is not the
        aim of the group.&nbsp;<span>The standard is advanced but if you speak a reasonable
        level of Italian you are welcome to come along and see if they enjoy it. People
        are expected to speak in Italian most of the time.</span></p>\\n<p><span>This
        means that if you speak no Italian sadly we are not the group for you. The
        aim of the group is to speak Italian and if people that only speak English
        attend it undermines the primary goal of the group.</span></p>\\n<p><span>You'll
        be amazed at how much progress you make in conversation after just a few events.
        People are there mostly because they want to improve, brush-up on their Italian
        or they are Italian. With about 40-60 people coming to the monthly events,
        it is easy to wander around and find people of your level with whom you feel
        really comfortable speaking Italian.</span></p>\\n<p>Simply join and if you
        are interested enough to come along, just click the appropriate button. An
        automatic mail message will be sent to you whenever a new event becomes available
        or if ever there is a change in the event.</p>\\n<p> <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/italian-35/messages/boards/thread/10250003\\\">Regular
        members have to pay £10 (£5 if you are unemployed)</a> and this is not optional
        if you wish to attend meetings. Paid members have first option on any events
        where attendance is limited.</p>\\n<p>Payment can be made in cash to myself

        - CORONAVIRUS &lt;br&gt;Organisers of this group want to make a couple of
        things clear.</p> \\n<p>We are neither epidemiologists nor outdoor conservationists.
        While we have done some research &amp; consulting, the medical profession
        and outdoor industry are not our main fields, and our philosophy is more along
        the lines of \\u201calways listen to the people who know more than us.\\u201d!</p>
        \\n<p>We however feel it's best for everyone to keep up to speed with the
        ever changing govt and local authorities Covid advice.</p> \\n<p><b>About
        Us (</b>we always play it safe, lively, adventureous, challenging, sometimes
        chaotic, but never dull\U0001F603!)</p> \\n<p>We, <b>a <i>non service </i>providing
        group of thrill seeking hiking 'buddies', </b>are dedicated to ascending peaks
        and enjoying panoramic views. We organise hikes in the hills around the country
        and abroad - occasionally going away on several days hiking trips. For each
        day's hike we generally aim to achieve at least 1000ft in total ascent and
        at least 12 miles distance. In the modest peaks in the south east this will
        mean linking several hills together which will sometimes lead to lengthier
        walks. On trips to the national parks we will endeavour to choose challenging
        walks taking in the major peaks (therefore bagging that magical 1000ft easily).
        A pub visit at the end of the walk is of course obligatory! If you are interested
        in some serious, decent paced hill and fell walking \\u2013 and can sign up
        to our <i>terms and conditions</i>, sign up to our group. <b>By joining this

        \\n<p>We provide information about an activity, meetup point, how to get there
        and where necessary where to stay overnight. The information provided are
        just plans, and like all plans you should know that unforeseen circumstances
        can force or require those plans to change; and for this group non of our
        organisers or members should be held liable for those changes.</p> \\n<p>We
        request attendees of our day hikes to contribute £5 towards costs of running
        this group and our charity <a href=\\\"https://secure.wateraidfundraising.org.uk/registrant/mobile/mobilePersonalPage.aspx?RegistrationID=451781&amp;Referrer=direct%2fnone&amp;moreDonations=true\\\">WaterAid</a>.
        &lt;br&gt;It is your responsibility to make sure you are adequately insured
        against any risks associated with our activities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p>Our organisers spend time and effort organising trips for attendees'
        benefit - prices for our away trips will include compensation for that effort
        and time and your contribution to our above mentioned charity.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p>BEFORE JOINING OUR TRIPS OUTSIDE LONDON: <b>You must meet organisers
        of such events first and well before the out of London event starts!</b></p>
        \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b>London 1000ft Hiking Club Terms and Conditions</b></p>
        \\n<p>We do not have leaders, tour guides, instructors, or experts. To describe
        and post a hike does not constitute nor should it convey any guarantee of
        safety, its succes nor the assumption of liability. To organise is to assemble
        details, disseminate information, and provide a little cohesion to an event
        by being the single point of contact for the participants. We do not provide
        any service nor do we tell you what to do. If you choose to ignore our or
        where it applies the guide's suggestions and recommendations you are well
        within your rights to do so - at your own risk and cost. Our suggestions and
        recommendations within trip descriptions are based upon the greater fund of
        knowledge presented by hiking literature and search &amp; rescue teams in
        general. You are strongly encouraged to do your own research, take hiking
        and navigation advice, and make your own plans to ensure your own safety,
        wherever and whatever you are doing.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>All our
        events require a good fitness level - <b>you are required to be healthy and
        fit</b> at the time of turning up for each event you sign up to.</p> \\n<p><b><i>We
        value cooperativeness and getting along.</i></b></p> \\n<p>Hiking is a hobby
        to us - so don't spoil it for us and the group. We therefore reserve the right
        to exclude people who are disruptive and show uncooperative, ill-mannered
        and welfare-threatening behaviours to others.</p> \\n<p>You must not abuse,
        harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate any other person including organisers
        of this group. We reserve the right to remove your membership (and all of
        your content), and terminate your rights under these Terms of Use without
        notice, if you take part in this conduct. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>We are NOT
        a travel agent and at no time are we liable for any costs that you might incur
        or would have incurred before being excluded from our group. Once again, we
        are a meetup group - an 'unincorporated association' and NOT a company, club,
        organisation or a charity - we have NO legal or financial obligations over
        any of our members and are NOT liable for any loss incured while participating
        in events organised by members or organisers of this group. <b>The best way
        to see our group is you have a bunch of hiking buddies to go on a hiking event
        with!</b></p> \\n<p>If something goes wrong you cannot reasonably expect the
        rest of the group to provide professional medical attention or professional
        rescue \\u2013 hiking often entails being many miles from prompt help. YOU
        must take this into consideration and YOU must take steps to reduce YOUR risk
        of injury, illness or other things that can go wrong - YOU must adequately
        insure yourself against any risks associated with our activities. This is
        true no matter who you hike with - your best friend, or an organised trip
        with the The London 1000ft Hiking Club. Wherever you go or whoever you go
        with, it is in your best interest to know the risks you are taking, ensure
        yourself against them and how to minimise the risks whilst participating in
        our events.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b>PAYMENTS AND REFUND POLICY</b></p>
        \\n<p>Once a payment for an event has been made NO refund can be given unless
        the event is cancelled by the organiser(s).</p> \\n<p>You can however recover
        your payments by selling your place to someone else meeting the fitness requirements
        of the event. YOU are responsible for the sale of your place - do not expect
        the organiser(s) of the event to do it for you (although they might assist
        in the sale if their time allows).</p> \\n<p><b>If you don't like it, don't
        take part!</b></p> \\n<p>We sometimes run costs recovery events to cover costs
        encurred during running this meetup group - obviously you are within your
        right not to attend such events where payment is required. Any of the mentioned
        above applies to such events.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b><i>By signing

        - November 2020</p>\\n<p>Dear South London Board Gamers,</p>\\n<p>We wanted
        to reach out to you and give you an update on South London Board Games. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Given
        the current COVID restrictions, and the risks COVID poses, we are going to
        forgo Face-to-Face meetings for the foreseeable future.</p>\\n<p>The COVID
        crisis will end, and when it does, we will return, though potentially in a
        different way. In the meantime, the Discord and the Meetup will remain live.
        If anyone would like to arrange something using the platforms, please let
        us know, and if possible, and safe, we will help.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, there
        has been a boom in digital board games across all platforms. We are looking
        to create a Virtual Meetup to embrace these, but the high cost of many of
        these games makes that problematic. The Organizers will try and come up with
        something in the coming weeks/months.</p>\\n<p>Until we can meet again as
        usual, please keep safe, and remember you are not alone. SLBG will return.</p>\\n<p>The
        SLBG Organisers</p>---\\n<p>Update - Spring 2020</p>\\n<p>In light of the
        outbreak of COVID-19/the Coronavirus, WE ARE GOING TO CANCEL ALL FORTHCOMING
        SESSIONS OF THE MEETUP. This was not an easy choice for us to make, but we
        believe it is the best way to keep everyone safe and healthy. We are not sure
        when we will restart, as this situation may rumble on for a long time. BUT
        WE WILL RETURN. We love gaming, and we are proud of the community that came
        together after Kyle founded the group all those years ago.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In
        the interim, while we will not be running groups, there is the <a href=\\\"https://discordapp.com/channels/523866954726113282/523866954726113284\\\">Discord
        Server</a>, which, if you haven\\u2019t joined already, you can join via this
        <a href=\\\"https://discord.gg/DY4wXFA\\\">link</a>. This should allow us
        to keep in touch, arrange \\u2018virtual meetups,\\u2019 and maybe play some
        video games together. We will also keep the MeetUp running for the foreseeable
        future.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Regarding the Coronavirus, please keep an eye on local
        guidance, but also the <a href=\\\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\\\">World
        Health Organization\\u2019s page</a> on it.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We aren\\u2019t
        going anywhere, and when we can, we will meet in person again. In the meantime,
        please keep an eye on the Discord Server,&nbsp;</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Stay safe,
        and if you can, keep gaming.&nbsp;</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Yours,</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>South

        the Brixton, Clapham, Balham area).&nbsp;</span><span>Most of the places we
        meet are typically pubs, which serve food.</span></p>\\n<p><span>We hope to
        offer a place where you can come learn, play and even teach games, some that
        you know, and some that are new to you.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p>Our members
        supply the games, so please bring any along that you have and really want
        to play. But don't worry if you don't have any - there are always a few of
        us that get excited and bring along more than we need!</p>\\n<p>The games
        we bring change from week-to-week, covering a wide range of different games,
        from party games (Werewolf, Secret Hitler, Bang!...) to co-op games (Pandemic,
        Dead of Winter, Mysterium...) to competitive games where you are trying to
        beat out your opponents in an all-out quest to victory (Ticket to Ride, Concordia,
        Great Western Trail).</p>\\n<p>We're a really friendly group - everyone is
        welcome especially if you've never played these kinds of games before. There
        is always someone on hand to explain the rules to a new game.</p>\",\"created\":1523058637000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        to join and attend, from Java Software engineers to aspiring Computer Science
        students to Product Managers to Agile Coaches. Plus anyone in between!</p>\\n<p>Almost
        always fuelled by pizza, this group will provide a platform for the Java community
        to exchange ideas and keep up to date with the latest movements and shifts
        in software development. The plan is to hold the meetups every other month
        - with 2 speakers on the roster. As we build momentum and members in the upcoming
        months, we are likely to broaden into pub meets, lightning talks etc.</p>\\n<p>So,
        if you enjoy Java and would like to socialise with others in the field, then
        please come along to one of our events.</p>\\n<p>We will be debuting in January

        group is primarily for cinema and debate lovers who enjoy discussing movies
        with a group of people in a casual environment. Simple, right?&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>So
        what\\u2019s the idea?&nbsp; <br> </b> <span>To get together in a casual environment
        (i.e pub) to discuss a movie we all agreed to watch. Just like in reading
        groups, we don't watch the film together, just discuss it with a group of
        people eager to hear your thoughts on the movie and share theirs with you.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why
        would she murder him? Was the butler lying? What fascinates you about the
        main character? Is the film-makers' reputation overrated? How did you feel
        about the ending?</span></p>\\n<p><span>These are only but a few examples
        of questions that may spring in your mind after watching a particular film.
        And this group is a place to share them with other people.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span><b>When
        and where do we meet?</b> <br>&nbsp;The idea was for us to get together one
        or two weekends a month in a pubs in central London. But we're flexible. <br>
        <br> <b>What films will we watch?</b> <br> As amateur cinema fans, we watch
        films regularly and we've got a very long list of films to suggest. Classics,
        French Cinema, World Cinema, thought-provoking films, Sci-Fi, contemporary,
        documentaries...A very wide range of genres.. And of course all suggestions
        are welcome.</span></p>\\n<p><b>What if I can't make it to a meetup?</b></p>\\n<p>Stuff
        happens and things crop up, we totally understand. If you can't make it to
        a meeting, all we ask is that you change your RSVP as soon as possible so
        that other people can have the opportunity to attend, and watch the film beforehand.
        If you are listed as a 'No-Show' three times (ie: you haven't changed your
        RSVP, or sent a message to let us know that you can't make it), we will unfortunately
        have to ask you to leave the group. Just to make it completely clear: If you
        let us know/change your RSVP, this is absolutely fine. : ) <br></p>\\n<p><span>S</span><span>ounds

        in the Pub (or Sceptics in the Pub, if you prefer) are groups which meet and
        converse in the UK and beyond, usually gathering once every month.</span></p>\\n<p><span>The
        event was founded in London, UK by Dr Scott Campbell in 1999, for all those
        interested in science, history, psychology, philosophy, investigative journalism
        and how to examine extraordinary claims of all types.</span></p>\\n<p><span>A
        speaker (or number of speakers) is invited each month to present a topic of
        interest, which is followed by a discussion in a relaxed and friendly pub
        atmosphere.</span></p>\\n<p><span>We make no claims to balance, and actively
        promote science, freedom of expression and secular humanism.&nbsp;This means
        we often end up talking about superstition, religious fundamentalism, censorship
        and conspiracy theory.</span></p>\\n<p><span> <br></span></p>\\n<p>The following&nbsp;<a
        href=\\\"http://skepticblog.org/2008/11/17/skeptic-the-name-thing-again/\\\">definition</a>,
        due to Steven Novella, pretty much sums up where we are coming from:</p>\\n<p>A
        skeptic is one who prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid
        to ones that are comforting or convenient, and therefore rigorously and openly
        applies the methods of science and reason to all empirical claims, especially
        their own.</p>\\n<p>A skeptic provisionally proportions acceptance of any
        claim to valid logic and a fair and thorough assessment of available evidence,
        and studies the pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so
        as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves.</p>\\n<p>Skepticism values
        method over any particular conclusion.</p>\\n<p>In short skepticism is an
        intellectual speciality that is grounded in science and the humanities and
        includes any knowledge that deals with the nature of knowledge and belief,
        critical thinking, the foibles of the human intellect, and deception. &nbsp;</p>\",\"created\":1249694949000,\"city\":\"High

        following description is for our in-person events, as organised up to March
        2020 (we expect to resume these in 2021, when it is safe to do so):</p>\\n<p>
        London International Meetup is an active group which arranges several different
        activities most weeks. It has been established since 2003 and has one of the
        largest memberships. Group sizes are restricted to appropriate levels and
        each event will have a small meetup charge to cover the organisation costs
        and to ensure the quality of the events. <br> <br> Our regular events include:
        <br> <br> <strong>- Social evenings (usually up to 40 people)</strong> <br>
        Come and meet other members. It is a friendly group and you will be welcomed
        by the organiser when you arrive. We try to use locations which do not have
        a lot of background noise. Food and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic)
        are available. <br> <br> <strong>- UK day trips (usually up to 20 people)</strong>
        <br> We organise day trips on most weekends, usually to a location within
        England. We travel by public transport (train and local buses or taxis). These
        are social events - in most cases the group remains together throughout the
        day, except when going to a busy festival. <br> <br> <strong>- Theatre shows
        (usually up to 10 people)</strong> <br> See a musical or play in one of the
        many theatres in London. This is a cheaper and more sociable way to enjoy
        either West End or off-West End shows. We sometimes do \\\"surprise theatre\\\"
        events for up to 4 people. As tickets have to be pre-purchased you will need
        to provide mobile phone contact details when you reply, for confirmation purposes
        <br> <br> <strong>- Walks (usually up to 20 people)</strong> <br> There is
        a monthly walk on a Sunday afternoon. Usually this follows a section of one
        of the special walking routes (eg the London Loop, the Capital Ring or the
        Thames Path). Lunch is usually in a pub or cafe along the route. A distance
        of 7-10 miles is followed at a sociable, medium pace. <br> <br> If you reply
        Yes to an event, please make sure that you turn up (or if necessary change
        your reply on the meetup website if you are unable to come). For events which
        involve tickets (eg day trips or theatre/concerts) usually you will be asked
        to give your full name and mobile phone number when you reply - please make
        sure that you provide these so that you can be contacted if necessary. <span>You
        may be removed from the group if you do not show up for a day trip or theatre
        show without changing your reply or notifying the organiser.</span></p>\",\"created\":1039197553000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        - 30/01/2021:&nbsp;<span>Hi everyone,</span></p>\\n<br>\\n<p>I hope everyone
        is doing well and sending you all lots of love during these difficult times.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>I
        just wanted to update and let everyone know I hope to return to the Meetup
        very soon. I have been gradually rebuilding up my level of responsibility
        with work, volunteering etc and putting together a manageable routine, slowly
        and steadily.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>I will never be as involved as I was previously,
        because unfortunately this wasn't healthy or sustainable and I need to be
        able to have time for myself too, instead of taking on lots of things and
        spreading myself thin as I have often done in the past. However, I hope to
        be able to host a meeting twice per month going forward to begin with, starting
        in <b>March 2021</b>.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Some polls/surveys will be distributed
        soon to gauge what kinds of events members here would like to see more or
        less of (keeping in mind that they will continue to be online until further
        notice). This will help shape the direction of the group and events available
        in future, and all responses will be completely anonymous.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Thank
        you so much to those who have been patient and supportive so far. I look forward
        to coming back. <b>I am sorry for any correspondence I have missed during
        this challenging time, and do intend to get some help with the administrative
        side of running the group.</b></p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Also, I am currently trialling
        a name change to Seren, but members are still welcome to call me Jaz if more
        comfortable until a full name change becomes official.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Lots
        of love,</p>\\n<p>Jaz/Seren ❤️</p>\\n<p>---</p>\\n<p>I understand these unprecedented
        times are a source of stress and uncertainty for many members. I highly recommend
        checking out these resources for ways of keeping connected, well and having
        plenty of things to do:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.marchnetwork.org/creative-isolation\\\">https://www.marchnetwork.org/creative-isolation</a></p>\\n<p><a

        REQUEST TO JOIN US OR CONTACT ME:</b></p>\\n<p><b>1.</b> By becoming a member,

        This is not a singles' group or a place to \\\"pick-up.\\\"</b> Members who
        get along can of course decide to date, but please do not use this group to
        seduce others. Members found to be attending events or sending unsolicited
        messages to others with the goal of \\\"chatting them up\\\" will be immediately
        banned without warning. This is intended to be a safe, relaxed and respectful
        environment for everyone.</p>\\n<p><b>3.</b> I will endeavour to approve join
        requests within 24 hours, but please be aware that this is dependent upon
        my availability to be online and to access Meetup. I am sorry for any inconvenience,
        but messages requesting that I approve your request will not speed up this
        process.</p>\\n<p><b>4. </b> If you have any questions, email me on leadinglightsocial(at)outlook(dot)com.
        <b>Please be aware that due to a very high volume of messages on Meetup and
        via email, I am unable to respond to everyone (though I do try my best).</b>
        If you have a question or concern about the group, or your enquiry is urgent,
        please send an email to the above address with \\\"IMPORTANT\\\" or \\\"URGENT\\\"
        in the title. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Please understand
        that this is never a personal reflection of the member contacting me: I simply
        lack the time and resources to single-handedly respond to dozens of messages
        daily, in addition to personal commitments and responsibilities. Having said
        this, it is <b>never</b> my intention to contribute to anyone's distress by
        making them feel ignored or rejected. If you don't hear back from me or your
        message is urgent, please feel free to give me a nudge. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>If
        you have a query about a specific event on our calendar, <b>please be sure
        to contact the designated Event Host</b>, as they are in the best position
        to provide information about their own events.</p>\\n<p><b>5.</b> Finally,
        please remember that this is a peer-led group. <b>It is not intended to serve
        as a professional mental health organisation or service, nor is it intended

        and hosts of this group are peers. We contribute our time because we care.
        Many of us have lived experience of shyness, social anxiety, low self-esteem,
        mental health conditions, disabilities or a combination of these things, currently
        or historically. We all do our best, but we are only human and none of us
        are perfect. <b>Please treat us with the same understanding you would want

        documentary, \\\"Stand Up to Shyness\\\", starring award-winning Welsh comedian
        <a href=\\\"http://www.rhodgilbertcomedian.com/\\\">Rhod Gilbert</a>. This

        Davis</a> spends time with many different communities to explore contemporary
        subcultures in the UK.</p>\\n<p>More recently, we have been featured by the
        <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_world_service\\\">BBC
        World Service</a> on their radio series, <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xtky9\\\">The

        is a peer-led social and support group for people to meet in London. Events
        include afternoon coffee, self-development workshops, karaoke, daytrips, regular
        dinners, weekly support groups and a wide variety of other Meetups, including
        women-only events and LGBTQ+ events.</p>\\n<p>Steve Light originally set up
        this group in 2010 to help people who are lonely, shy, socially anxious, have
        low self-esteem etc (hence members being called 'SociaLights'). Since 2013,
        I have been running this group in his place, which has been a great honour.
        What began as a bi-weekly pub social has expanded in the last few years beyond
        imagination.</p>\\n<p>We are an incredibly diverse group: We embrace members
        of all ages (18 and above), backgrounds, beliefs, circumstances and experiences.
        We aim to be an inclusive community for everyone, which is reflected in our
        range of events and core values as a group.</p>\\n<p>This is a welcoming,
        safe place where you can meet like-minded people, receive support and make
        new friends, all in a social setting. We are not only the largest mental health
        Meetup community in the world, we are also ranked as the <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/topics/shy/\\\">biggest
        shyness and social anxiety Meetup group</a> too.</p>\\n<p>Please don't be
        intimidated by this: In some Meetups, larger groups are split. Additionally,
        events specifically for small groups take place. Hosts are always happy to
        deal with any queries you may have and ensure that you are in a comfortable
        space. We strive to be a warm and close community, and always will, regardless
        of group size!</p>\\n<p>Being shy is not a necessity to join us. The only
        things you need are an open mind, an open heart and a desire for human company.
        :)</p>\\n<p>Some Meetups will be structured so that people can take it in
        turns to talk, other Meetups will be general and social. Rest assured, you
        will be around a warm group of people who care and understand.</p>\\n<p>This
        is a Private Group: This means that non-members cannot see who is in this
        group, the discussions or any Meetup details (aside from the title, date,
        time and how many people are attending). This measure is in place to protect
        the privacy and security of everyone in the group.</p>\\n<p>~~~</p>\\n<p>To

        Procedure</a>.</p>\\n<p>I understand and respect that this group might not
        be what you're looking for, and that's okay. Here are other <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/leadinglightsocial/messages/boards/thread/49367703\\\">Recommended

        about bringing like-minded people that share similar genuine passions&nbsp;together
        in a relaxed fun social setting. Whether it's a particular genre of music,&nbsp;theatre
        / acting, food, dancing/clubing, singing/rockoake, comedy, art, cutting edge
        science,&nbsp;spirituality -&nbsp; we host free fun social events centered
        around a common theme that you must be passionate about.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>\\n<p>You'll
        get to explore a diverse range of fully hosted activities and fun times both
        by day &amp; night- hosted by born Londoners who knows the city and all of
        its hidden gems inside out! We also avoid holding events in touristy/sleazy
        venues so attendees get to enjoy authentic London experiences and meet natives
        without&nbsp;<span>hassle</span></p>\\n<p><span>Our membership base is biased
        towards&nbsp;</span><span>sociable,&nbsp;</span><span>outgoing, intellectual,
        creative and successful but unpretentious young urban professionals with a
        wicked sense of humour with highly engaging passionate personalities. We value
        quality over&nbsp;mediocrity so attempt to constrict attendees to people that
        genuinely love the event theme to ensure only like minded people gets a chance
        to participate, and to keep attendees to a manageable size.&nbsp; If you're
        looking for just another unfiltered social group there are zillions out there
        you can join!</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span>Typical past events have included
        stargazing,&nbsp;rockaoke,&nbsp;music themed club nights, halloween pub crawls/tours,
        exhibitions, dinners/food tasting/supper club, lunches/brunch, coffee, social
        sporting events/games, firework displays, talks/seminars, concerts.</span></p>\\n<p>In
        terms of waiting lists, when places become available, preference will be given
        to people with complete profiles who can demonstrate a genuine passion for
        the subject area, and to loyal members and&nbsp;acquaintances/friends.</p>\\n<p>And
        here at Chillout, our philosophy is you shouldn't have to pay a high premium
        to enjoy the things that you love so in accordance with the&nbsp;fundamental
        founding tenet of Meetup - we keep the vast majority of our events free to
        attend - no profit motive here! However in rare cases, w<span>here direct
        or venue costs are incurred for putting on a specific event, there maybe a
        small charge.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p>So, whether you\\u2019re originally from
        London or brand new to the city, here's to enjoying some fun times out and

        We're open to anyone who wants to improve and share their skills, and our

        Proposals for 15-25 minute presentations to get us started are <i>extremely</i>
        welcome. As in, I will shower you in gratitude and/or beer.</p>\\n<p><b>What
        on earth is a CTF?&nbsp;</b>Each month, a member writes a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security\\\">Capture-the-Flag</a>
        - a technical puzzle - for other members to solve. At the next meeting, the
        winners present their solution, and the first person to solve the CTF writes
        the challenge for the next month. Topics include things like binary reverse
        engineering, breaking simple crypto, or analysing network services. Generally,
        no prior knowledge is expected - the challenges are sometimes obscure, and
        you're expected to do a little bit of research to figure it out.</p>\\n<p><b>Want

        we will be meeting to go out for food. Restaurant recommendations are always

        Club rides are typically 50 miles for Steadies; 50 to 60 miles for Inters;
        60 to 70 miles for Inter+ and 70 to 80 miles for the Advanced. All our club
        rides involve a break at the half way point for a coffee and a sandwich. Many

        all the skills you need to speak with confidence and become the speaker that
        others look forward to listening to! This group meets every Monday evening
        at 7pm <b>ONLINE</b> to practice delivering speeches and speaking on impromptu
        topics. </p>\\n<p>Usually, we are a face-to-face group but for the next few
        months will be online until we are ready to return to our local pub<i> The
        Shipwright Arms, </i>in London Bridge<i>.</i></p>\\n<p>Our club members are
        a mix of levels and we welcome guests of every level to join us too! Whether
        the very thought of speaking in public fills you with fear, or if you love
        standing up to speak in front of a crowd, you will learn something new by
        attending our meetings.</p>\\n<p>..............................................................................................................................
        <br>While we can learn some tips and tricks about delivering speeches from
        watching talks or reading books, it is by practicing and delivering speeches
        regularly that we learn to master the art of public speaking. </p>\\n<p>As
        the leading weekly public speaking club in London we have an average attendance
        of 45 encouraging and supportive members and guests each week. That's a lot
        of people to learn from in a fun and friendly environment! <br>.............................................................................................................................&nbsp;
        <br>There is no fee to attend any of our meetings as a guest and absolutely
        no obligation to join. You can also join as many meetings as you want to as
        a guest. You will not be called upon to speak during the meeting unless you
        wish to do so.</p>\\n<p>When you decide to join, a full year\\u2019s membership
        of our club is just £168 plus a one-off payment of £30 to Toastmasters International
        which pays for all your speech manuals and a monthly magazine. <br>..............................................................................................................................&nbsp;
        <br>We hope to see you in our next meeting! Please arrive at 18:55 so that
        we can talk you through how our meetings work.</p>\",\"created\":1532466152000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        Your Everyday and get active outdoors!</b></p>\\n<p>Do you sit at your desk
        or when you're commuting wishing this year you could escape the boring mundane
        and get away on a weekend or holiday that would be filled with fun, adventure
        and try something new with like minded enthusiasts? Have you always wanted
        to try different sporting activities without having to join a specific club
        or join in on a challenge with a group of like-minded enthusiasts? Who we
        are?</p>\\n<p>We've been organising club trips, challenges and events for
        a number of years. We realised that everyone who enjoys being active outdoors
        has an interest in trying different sports but not necessarily wanting to
        compete at any club or competition level. We finally decided to put together
        a group with a focus on trying different outdoor activities along with some
        trips and challenges that are fun, exciting and above all else, suitable for
        any age group or ability. We will be organising a range of taster events from
        single days and weekends throughout the year for anyone to come along and
        try a new outdoor activity. This will give you an insight into to what it
        will be like to come along on one of our Escape Your Everyday trips and challenges.</p>\\n<p><b>What
        do we do?</b></p>\\n<p>We organise a wide variety of weekend activities for
        everyone to join in, such as trail walking, hiking, climbing road cycling
        and off road biking, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, paddling on the Thames
        - plus much more. We also organise adventures and challenges not just in the
        UK but all over Europe, catering for all abilities. It doesn\\u2019t matter
        if you\\u2019ve never hiked, biked, paddled or skied before, we can accommodate
        you as long as you have a basic level of fitness and a desire to get outdoors.
        Our Activity Leaders are highly experienced and will be on hand to advise
        and support you throughout the event and to ensure your activity experience
        with us is a smooth one. How regularly do you meet? We running events and
        trips throughout the year, choosing the right locations based on the weather
        conditions, no mountain climbing in winter! Even when the weather is too bad
        to really enjoy the outdoors, there's always a pub to hike or bike to for
        a meal and social gathering and an opportunity for you to meet other enthusiasts
        or speak to our group leaders. The starting point for most activities is normally
        from central Reading to ensure we can arrange enough transportation for anyone
        travelling by train and we are becoming one of the fastest growing outdoor
        activities clubs serving the Thames Valley, London and the South. Why we do
        it? Finding the motivation to get outdoors on your own every week is not always
        easy and often it's hard to find friends or are able to join in. By setting
        up this group, we have created an active outdoors social club of like minded
        individuals. We\\u2019re passionate about getting outdoor, being active and
        trying new challenges and we want to create the largest outdoors social group

        with my husband, as a couple. I would like this group to be built on FUN.
        Activities could include after work drinks, lazy weekend pub lunches, picnics,

        Feminist Books Group\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/London-Feminist-Books-Group/\",\"urlname\":\"London-Feminist-Books-Group\",\"description\":\"<p>This
        is an inclusive book group that focuses on gender politics and feminist literature.
        We read a mixture of non-fiction and fiction including essays, short stories,
        novels and poetry. The idea is to stretch our brains a bit and generally just
        have a good time reading, discussing and listening to others and to make new
        friends. You don\\u2019t have to identify as a feminist or a woman or have
        any particular knowledge or background to join this group, and there's no
        pressure to contribute to the discussion if you'd prefer to listen. However,
        it is important to us that the group is welcoming to all and celebrates diversity.
        We will consciously use books to explore how feminism sometimes excludes marginalised
        communities (such as people of colour, disabled people, members of the LGBT
        community etc) and how it needs to grow in response to this.</p>\\n<p> <br><b>Format
        of the meetups</b></p>\\n<p>We usually meet on the third Wednesday of each
        month. Each meetup we have a focused discussion of the chosen book and then
        hold a vote to decide the book for the meeting in 2 months\\u2019 time. This
        gives everyone 2 months to obtain and read each book. A list of potential
        titles is available <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mjy-NM-F3dwkWOk_o3GRF5LJI_U6CmAn6XFiwQTv2DI/edit?usp=sharing\\\">here</a>
        and we welcome suggestions for additions to this list!</p>\\n<p><span>For
        each meetup there is an optional contribution of £1 per person to the cost
        of running the group.&nbsp;</span><br></p>\\n<p><span>We request that everyone
        attending buys something in the venue, whether food, non-alcoholic drink,
        or alcoholic drink. Unfortunately, the private quiet spaces we need for book
        club do not come for free. The logistics of a hire fee or minimum spend would
        be prohibitive, so instead we rely on the good will of the pubs, which in
        turn relies on members spending (a little) money. Please also avoid bringing
        your own food and drink (except water/medical necessities) as pubs generally
        frown on this. We think this is a reasonable requirement.&nbsp;</span><br></p>\\n<p>We
        try to ensure that the books chosen are available for a reasonable price (and
        to achieve this we may sometimes have to change the book chosen by the group
        if it proves to be expensive or unavailable). You may also be able to use
        your local library to borrow a hard copy or eBook for free. (This has the
        added benefit of being better for the environment and helping local services
        to justify their continued existence.)<br></p>\\n<p>So that we can set up
        the room correctly, please change your RSVP in advance of the meeting as soon
        as possible if you are unable to come along.</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<p><b>Purpose
        of the group</b></p>\\n<p>We aim to create a safe, mixed gender space to discuss
        feminist books. </p>\\n<p><i>We are a book group</i></p>\\n<p>The focus of
        our discussions is therefore on the book as a book \\u2013 its tone of voice,
        how well it is structured, how accessible it is, how well it communicates
        its message, whether it is something we would recommend to others, how it
        fits in around other aspects of feminism and other writings. Naturally we
        will also look at its content and the issues it raises. However we wish to
        do this while keeping reference to the book.</p>\\n<p>We are not a debating
        group. The purpose of the group is not to debate the need for feminism or
        to focus on individual feminist issues. Nor are we an activist group or a
        consciousness raising group. We recognise the importance of all of these different
        activities (and at times our discussion may touch on all of them) but we ask
        that members respect the purpose of the group and engage in discussion with
        that in mind. </p>\\n<p><i>We are a mixed gender group </i></p>\\n<p>We recognise
        that some people would be more comfortable in gender segregated groups. However,
        there are others for whom a mixed group would be more comfortable. We therefore
        believe it is important that both segregated and mixed gender groups exist.</p>\\n<p>We
        chose to run a mixed gender group because we wish to welcome people of all
        genders to discuss feminist books. Our <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/London-Queer-Books-Group/\\\">queer
        book club</a> has shown us that having a mixed gender group discussing gender
        issues results in some enlightening discussions. We hope this will be a great
        opportunity to learn more about the background of feminism and gender issues
        and explore new ideas.</p>\\n<p><b> <br></b></p>\\n<p><b>Code of conduct</b></p>\\n<p>We
        have prepared the following code of conduct to help ensure that each discussion
        is interesting and enjoyable for everyone present. We hope that the points
        contained in it will seem like common sense.&nbsp; If you have any comments
        or suggestions on the code of conduct, please contact the organisers using
        the message function on meetup and they will take your points into consideration.</p>\\n<p>Everyone
        is deemed to have accepted the rules of this code of conduct when they join
        the group, post on webpages associated with the group and/or attend an event
        run by the group. If you do not accept this code of conduct you must leave
        the group.</p>\\n<p>We, the organisers of the group, may modify the terms
        of this code of conduct from time to time at our sole discretion, which we
        will do by updating this document and posting it on the group\\u2019s meetup
        page.</p>\\n<p><b>General behaviour</b></p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;We expect everyone
        who joins this group to accept and be comfortable with it being a book group
        (see above)</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;We expect everyone who joins this group
        to accept and be comfortable with it being a mixed gender group (see above).</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;You
        do not have to stay at a meetup event if you feel uncomfortable. You can leave
        at any time. </p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;You do not have to participate in the
        discussion. It is fine to just come and listen. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Do
        not pressure anyone else to take part in an activity or to disclose information
        about themselves. Respect other people\\u2019s privacy and their boundaries.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Do
        not monopolize the time of the meeting: allow others to contribute to the
        discussion by not interrupting, not having side conversations and not talking
        for an excessive amount of time. </p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;People will have different
        views and interpretations. Respect the individuality and views of others.
        Do not use the discussion as a vehicle to try to convince other people that
        they are wrong. State your view but then move on.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Please
        remember that everyone is at a different stage of awareness about various
        issues. It is fine to point out if something is problematic, but do not assume
        someone is being malicious.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;If you are unsure of the
        pronoun someone uses we encourage you to ask them or avoid gendered language
        by using \\u201cthey\\u201d instead of \\u201che\\u201d or \\u201cshe\\u201d.
        If you ask someone or are corrected about pronouns, please try to use them
        correctly. We expect everyone to accept a person\\u2019s self-identified gender.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Do
        not shout, use offensive language, insult anyone or threaten anyone.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;Do
        not make negative comments or assumptions, or stereotype people on the basis
        of their ethnicity, class, accent, appearance, gender, disability, sexuality,
        religion/belief, age, lifestyle or any other factor. Bigoted behaviour of
        any kind will not be tolerated.</p>\\n<p><b>Dealing with issues</b></p>\\n<p>The
        organisers will try to deal fairly and respectfully with any issue brought
        to us. If you want support in challenging anyone\\u2019s behaviour or anything
        they\\u2019ve said, please come and talk to one of the organisers or email
        us via the meetup page.</p>\\n<p>Things we may do to deal with a problem:</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;communicate
        to the people concerned that there is a problem and reiterate how we expect
        people in the group to behave</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;ask for an apology</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;delete
        a post</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;ask the people concerned to leave you alone</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;give
        the people concerned a warning</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;exclude the people concerned
        from the group</p>\\n<p>These will be implemented at the discretion of the
        organisers. The organisers\\u2019 decision is final. We may also make reasonable
        requests that are not specifically included here. <br></p>\",\"created\":1426078752000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        Queer Books Group\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/London-Queer-Books-Group/\",\"urlname\":\"London-Queer-Books-Group\",\"description\":\"<p>This
        is a book club that focuses on queer literature, from the trashy to the highbrow.
        We read long tomes, graphic novels, short stories and even non-fiction, whatever
        takes our fancy. The aim of the group is to celebrate non-normative gender
        and sexuality, bring queer culture to life, learn about queer history and
        make new friends. You don\\u2019t have to identify as anything to join this
        group.</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<p><b>Format of the group</b></p>\\n<p>We usually
        meet on the first Wednesday of every month. Each meetup we discuss the chosen
        book, have a free-for-all natter and hold a vote to decide the book for the
        next-but-one meeting. This gives everyone 2 months to obtain and read each
        book. We have a booklist that has been compiled by members over the years,
        but any book can be put forward for the vote. Book suggestions are always
        welcome. :)</p>\\n<p>For each meetup there is an optional contribution of
        £1 per person to the cover the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://meetup.com/\\\">meetup.com</a>&nbsp;<span>subs.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><span>We
        request that everyone attending buys something in the venue, whether food,
        non-alcoholic drink, or alcoholic drink. Unfortunately, the private quiet
        spaces we need for book club do not come for free. The logistics of a hire
        fee or minimum spend would be prohibitive, so instead we rely on the good
        will of the pubs, which in turn relies on members spending (a little) money.
        Please also avoid bringing your own food and drink (except water/medical necessities)
        as pubs generally frown on this. We think this is a reasonable requirement.<br><br>We
        try to ensure that the books chosen are available for a reasonable price (and
        to achieve this we may sometimes have to change the book chosen by the group
        if it proves to be expensive or unavailable). You may also be able to use
        your local library to borrow a hard copy or eBook for free. (This has the
        added benefit of being better for the environment and helping local services
        to justify their continued existence.)<br></span></p>\\n<p><span>So that we
        can set up the room correctly, please change your RSVP in advance of the meeting
        as soon as possible if you are unable to come along. In the case of oversubscription
        for an event we may prioritise members without a history of no-shows.</span><br></p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Purpose
        of the group</p>\\n<p>We aim to create a safe, mixed gender space to discuss
        books having themes relevant to LGBTQIA+ people, and in general those with
        gender, sexual and relationship diversity. </p>\\n<br>\\n<p>We are a book
        group</p>\\n<p>The focus of our discussions is therefore on the book as a
        book \\u2013 its tone of voice, how well it is structured, how accessible
        it is, how well it communicates its message, whether it is something we would
        recommend to others, how it fits in with LGBTQIA+ issues and other writings.
        Naturally we will also look at its content and the issues it raises. However
        we wish to do this while keeping reference to the book. We are not a debating
        group. Nor are we an activist group or a consciousness raising group. We recognise
        the importance of all of these different activities (and at times our discussion
        may touch on all of them) but we ask that members respect the purpose of the
        group and engage in discussion with that in mind.</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>Code of
        conduct</p>\\n<p>We have prepared the following code of conduct to help ensure
        that each discussion is interesting and enjoyable for everyone present. We
        hope that the points contained in it will seem like common sense. If you have
        any comments or suggestions on the code of conduct, please contact the organisers
        using the message function on meetup and they will take your points into consideration.</p>\\n<p>Everyone
        is deemed to have accepted the rules of this code of conduct when they join
        the group, post on webpages associated with the group and/or attend an event
        run by the group. If you do not accept this code of conduct you must leave
        the group.</p>\\n<p>We, the organisers of the group, may modify the terms
        of this code of conduct from time to time at our sole discretion, which we
        will do by updating this document and posting it on the group\\u2019s meetup
        page.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>General behaviour</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 We expect
        everyone who joins this group to accept and be comfortable with it being a
        book group (see above)</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 You do not have to stay at a meetup
        event if you feel uncomfortable. You can leave at any time.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        You do not have to participate in the discussion. It is fine to just come
        and listen.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 Do not pressure anyone else to take part in an
        activity or to disclose information about themselves. Respect other people\\u2019s
        privacy and their boundaries.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 Do not monopolize the time
        of the meeting: allow others to contribute to the discussion by not interrupting,
        not having side conversations and not talking for an excessive amount of time.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        People will have different views and interpretations. Respect the individuality
        and views of others. Do not use the discussion as a vehicle to try to convince
        other people that they are wrong. State your view but then move on.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        Please remember that everyone is at a different stage of awareness about various
        issues. It is fine to point out if something is problematic, but do not assume
        someone is being malicious.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 If you are unsure of the pronoun
        someone uses we encourage you to ask them or avoid gendered language by using
        \\u201cthey\\u201d instead of \\u201che\\u201d or \\u201cshe\\u201d. If you
        ask someone or are corrected about pronouns, please try to use them correctly.
        We expect everyone to accept a person\\u2019s self-identified gender.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        Do not shout, use offensive language, insult anyone or threaten anyone.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022
        Do not make negative comments or assumptions, or stereotype people on the
        basis of their ethnicity, class, accent, appearance, gender, disability, sexuality,
        religion/belief, age, lifestyle or any other factor. Bigoted behaviour of
        any kind will not be tolerated.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Dealing with issues</p>\\n<p>The
        organisers will try to deal fairly and respectfully with any issue brought
        to us. If you want support in challenging anyone\\u2019s behaviour or anything
        they\\u2019ve said, please come and talk to one of the organisers or email
        us via the meetup page.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Things we may do to deal with
        a problem:</p>\\n<p>\\u2022 communicate to the people concerned that there
        is a problem and reiterate how we expect people in the group to behave</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022
        ask for an apology</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 delete a post</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022
        ask the people concerned to leave you alone</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 give the
        people concerned a warning</p>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 exclude the people concerned
        from the group</p>\\n<p>These will be implemented at the discretion of the
        organisers. The organisers\\u2019 decision is final. We may also make reasonable
        requests that are not specifically included here.&nbsp;</p>\",\"created\":1243598069000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        always.</p>\\n<p><b>Mark</b></p>\\n<p>The model Cate was superb with a wonderful
        classical figure, excellent choice of poses and a very nice way of asking
        what people wanted - such as whether to wear her hair up or down. Her hair
        is in fact really long blonde and cascading which some of us found difficult
        to draw well so in the second half she wore it up. The music was interesting
        without being strident and most people arrived before the session began. the
        room was noticeably more full than last time. By contrast THE CAMEL was less

        Cafe. We didn't know each other before starting the group, and we're very
        welcoming to Fresh Blood. If you want to have a drink and a play of some cracking
        games, do come and join us!</p> \\n<p>£5 a head (for the venue). <br>PLEASE
        BRING YOUR OWN FOOD AND DRINK. <br>The cafe is closed in the evenings, we're
        just hiring the space. But for the price of a single pint in the pub, you
        can bring a six pack of beer or a bottle of wine/tequila! Welcome to bring
        snacks or dinner or order food in.</p> \\n<p>The address is 28 Grove Lane,
        but the cafe entrance is down the side of the building along Melbourne Grove
        10/20 metres.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt; Ignore the number of people saying they're
        coming on here, btw. It's not the only source of Fellow Geeks! We are usually
        between 4 and 12 people each week. Large enough to be an event. Small enough

        from 4 to 15 miles in length and cover the attractive countryside of East

        the High Weald or Ashdown Forest. <br></p>\\n<p>--- <br></p>\\n<blockquote>

        are regularly between ten and thirty people on our walks, which take place
        every Sunday throughout the year, and often on Wednesday evenings during the
        lighter summer months. We like to provide a choice of two Sunday walks in
        different locations whenever possible. Various styles and types of walks are
        offered by our leaders. Full details for the current period are given in the

        train from Brighton and do not require the use of cars. All walks with a public

        programme</a> to see if there are any last minute changes to a particular
        walk. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are on time and ready for
        the start of the walk. Remember that postcodes are not always accurate, especially
        in rural areas. It is therefore important to check the starting location indicated
        on the map shown in the online walks programme, as well as noting any specific
        directions. </p>\\n<p>As for what equipment to bring: suitable footwear, such
        as walking boots or walking shoes, something to keep you dry if it rains and
        something to keep you warm when it is cold.</p>\\n<p> We always recommend
        bringing a packed lunch. Some walks are picnic only and this is stated in
        the walk description. It is important that members do not consume their own
        picnic lunches in pub gardens unless the landlord has granted permission.

        WALKS for reasonably fit people with at least a little country walking experience.
        May include unsurfaced rural paths. Walking boots and warm, waterproof clothing
        are recommended. May include a few short ascents and descents.</p>\\n<p>\\u2022&nbsp;
        &nbsp;\\u2018M\\u2019&nbsp; MODERATE WALKS for people with country walking
        experience and a good level of fitness. May include some steep paths and open
        country or could be more than 9 miles in length. Walking boots and warm, waterproof
        clothing are essential.</p>\\n<p>It should be noted that we rarely have an
        official backmarker, so the onus is on you to always keep sight of another
        member of the group in front. The walk leader's concentration will mainly
        be on the route ahead, which can be sometimes be complex, so they may not
        be fully aware of everything happening behind them. Do call out if you need
        to draw attention anything specific. We also suggest that you make a note
        of their mobile phone number for possible use if an emergency arises during
        the walk, although network signals are still poor in many local areas. You
        will find individual contact numbers in the <a href=\\\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/find-a-walk-or-route.aspx?group=SX02&amp;tab=walks\\\">walks
        programme</a>. <br></p>\\n<p>DOGS</p>\\n<p>With the exception of Registered
        Assistance dogs (eg guide dogs), dogs will only be welcome on walks with the
        express permission of the individual walk leader, whose decision is final.
        To avoid any confusion, walkers bringing dogs must always check beforehand
        with the walk leader, unless a particular walk is already listed in the <a
        href=\\\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/find-a-walk-or-route.aspx?group=SX02&amp;tab=walks\\\">walks
        programme</a> as being 'dog friendly'. These walks can easily be identified
        by checking the filter under the 'suitability' tab. All dogs should be closely
        controlled, kept on a lead where appropriate, and should not alarm other walkers.

        writers, hello! If you're in need of a writing group of like-minded individuals
        - congratulations, you've found it. Welcome.&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>At its heart,
        London Writers' Cafe gives emerging fiction writers a place to find constructive
        feedback on their work. Join us and learn more about finding the right agent
        or publishers, writing more frequently, editing your own work and becoming
        more confident through professional talks, critique and workshops.</p>\\n<p>We
        were founded in June 2006 in a lovely pub near Liverpool Street.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Our
        writers are at every stage of the writing process from first sentence to seeking
        an agent so it doesn't matter if you've been writing for years, or just a
        few months, we're here for everyone and we'd love to meet you. All membership
        requests are reviewed before approval so please answer the questions we've
        asked in a sentence or two.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Lastly, we don't believe in groups
        where everyone is forced to contribute/offer feedback *shudder* so we'll never
        pressure anyone to read before they're ready. Read more from Lisa on <a href=\\\"http://www.publishingtalk.eu/writing/thinking-of-joining-a-writing-group-ask-yourself-these-8-questions-first/\\\">what
        makes a quality writing group</a>.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p><b>Group feedback and writing
        advice sessions&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>In our regular writing workshops, members
        volunteer to read up to 3,500 words in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Reading
        spaces are 30 minutes long; time enough to read and hear feedback from the
        group.&nbsp; Feedback is moderated so it's practical, constructive and encouraging
        - we're not in the business of killing dreams but we are here to help each
        writer improve. We also have sessions of writing together where pieces are
        not shared and it's all about getting words on the page.</p>\\n<p><b>Talks,
        workshops &amp; socials with publishing professionals </b></p>\\n<p>In addition
        to creative writing critiques and writing sessions, we host an array of professional
        seminars and technical writing workshops on elements of craft i.e. charchaterisation,
        pacing, plot, tension and much more that are taught by<span>&nbsp;literary
        agents, editors, book doctors, script writers and publishers.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p>We're
        also known for our memorable social events and parties.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We
        hope to meet you very soon and happy writing! <br></p>\\n<p>Lisa &amp; Liz&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>***</p>\\n<p><b>Socialise

        it harm none do what ye will</span></span>\\\"</p>\\n<p>Dooreen Valiente (Thames
        Valley Coven)</p>\\n<p>The London Wicca Meetup Group is a common first port
        of call for those in the South East of England who are interested in Wicca.
        It is run by the Order of the Horse and Moon whose primary coven is the Coven
        of the Horse and the Moon. We are the largest and most active Wiccan group
        on Meetup in the UK and one of the major forces within the Wiccan tradition
        in this country.</p>\\n<p><span>The group has the following objectives</span></p>\\n<p><span>1)
        To allow Wiccans to meet like minded individuals who are interested in the
        subject.</span></p>\\n<p><span>2) To allow those interested in Wicca to learn
        more about its practice.</span></p>\\n<p>3) To facilitate the practice of
        Wiccan rites</p>\\n<p>4) To provide a way for individuals to join a Wiccan
        coven</p>\\n<p>The group provides a straightforward access point to the Wiccan
        tradition and we are dedicated to facilitating access to initiatory coven
        Wicca for all seekers. We have a strong record of facilitating initiation
        into Wicca and Witchcraft with many intiations taking place in the last year.
        Although this site is run by Cochranian Wiccans we have helped facilitate
        into a number of different covens. These traditions in which initiations have
        taken place include Cochranian and Gardnerian Wicca and Traditional Witchcraft.
        We have many neophytes and novices in training currently in different Wiccan
        lines. We seek to match the seeker with the tradition of their choosing.</p>\\n<p>Our
        Order and coven websites are below</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://ootham.wordpress.com\\\">http://ootham.wordpress.com</a></p>\\n<p><a
        href=\\\"http://covenofthehorseandmoon.wordpress.com/\\\">http://covenofthehorseandmoon.wordpress.com/</a></p>\\n<p>We
        also run a major Wicca website at</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.wicca.org.uk\\\">http://www.wicca.org.uk</a></p>\\n<p>We
        run a full set of eight Sabbats. Four are public rites and four are social
        meetups in pub with training for new members. These can be attended by any
        member or friend.</p>\\n<p><span>We also run a cycle of Esbats. Within our
        coven structure an esbat is normally held on every full moon, although occasionally
        these events may be open to guests normally they are not . They are held on
        the full moon, and are normally held in private houses. The Order of the Horse
        and its associated covens also hold a number of events not on meetup which
        are for the members associated with the covens. Although the covens are spiritual
        groups they are also groups of friends and hold their own gatherings.</span></p>\\n<p><span>We
        try to avoid bringing members to events in private houses who are unknown
        to our network unless they are with a friend we know. Additionally we are
        a group for Wiccans. Our focus is on those seeking to join the Wiccan path.
        The simply curious are welcome to attend our public events. If you are &nbsp;committed
        to another spiritual path we will not seek to convert you and there would
        not be much benefit to you coming to our group.</span></p>\\n<p><span>The
        Order of the Horse and the Moon runs a correspondence course over seven month
        called 'Seven Moons to Magic'. This introduces Wicca and normally offers the
        option of initiation into Cochranian Wicca for those who seek it. The course
        is free, however there is a requirement to complete written work and pay postage
        costs for those who are continuing to work through the course.</span></p>\\n<p>The
        group is also limited to the over 21s. We have special arrangements for those
        who are 20.</p>\",\"created\":1336352008000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        Weekend Sailing\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/Book-a-Berth-Sailing/\",\"urlname\":\"Book-a-Berth-Sailing\",\"description\":\"<p>A
        group for people who like the idea of spending the weekend (or longer) on
        the water, sailing. We have access to great yachts that are perfect for a
        gentle cruise along the coast or perhaps a cross-Channel trip to France or
        the Channel Islands. It's perfect for people who want to go sailing but can't
        get enough people together to charter a whole boat. Novices are equally welcome
        to see what it's like on a yacht.</p> \\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/3/3/600_435636659.jpeg\\\"></p>
        \\n<p>All the trips are led by a professional sailing instructor who will
        get everyone involved hoisting sails, taking the helm and just keeping watch.
        All levels are welcome from novice to experienced, there really is something
        for everyone. So here are some basics:</p> \\n<p><b>WHAT?</b> We organise
        weekend sailing events on large yachts and catamarans for up to 10 'crew'
        with a professional skipper. We usually start events on a Friday evening after
        work (or Saturday monrning) and join the professional skipper for a meal and
        a drink in the local sailor's pub the Castle Tavern or The Lightship. Then
        on Saturday we set off for a sail to our chosen destination making best use
        of the tides and the winds. Everyone is encouraged to get involved in handling
        the boat and the skippers are also sailing instructors, so they're happy to
        demonstrate any aspect of the boat that's of interest. By the end of a long
        day on the water, we'll all have made some new friends. We spend the night
        in a marina perhaps in the Isle of Wight or further afield and again we'd
        go ashore for a meal in a local restaurant/pub. After a deserved lie on Sunday,
        we head back to our base making the most of the day. We aim to be back around
        5pm, so there's time to tidy up before departing. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b>WHEN?</b>
        There's something going on every month from March through to November. &lt;br&gt;</p>
        \\n<p><b>WHERE?</b> The yachts are based in Haslar Marina in Portsmouth Harbour.
        There's free parking if coming by car or it's an easy train journey from Waterloo
        to Portsmouth Harbour station and then a short ferry ride across to Gosport.
        Our sailing destinations include: &lt;br&gt;- Local trips in and around the
        Solent which are perfect for spending more time 'learning the ropes' &lt;br&gt;-
        Coastal mile-builders to Poole, Weymouth or Brighton, a bit further afield
        for those wanting to leave the Solent and get 'out to Sea' &lt;br&gt;- Cross
        Channel hops for the more adventurous to Cherbourg or Alderney. &lt;br&gt;On
        longer trips (Easter perhaps) there's time to go further afield to Guernsey
        and Sark perhaps. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b>WHO?</b> No experience is required
        and the trips are suitable for complete beginners as long as you are keen.
        If you've done some sailing before, you'll find it's a great way to go sailing
        without having to get enough people to share the cost of chartering a yacht
        and you can still get involved in the navigation and passage planning without
        the worry about being responsible. Come with a group or come alone, you are
        certain to make new friends on the boat. And the skipper is there to keep
        the weekend organised and sociable. &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p><b>WHY?</b> The group
        is for those who love sailing or who love the sea or who just want to get
        fresh air in their lungs and make the absolute most of their weekend.</p>

        is a happy friendly group where we simply exchange experiences about how you've
        been bullied or someone you know has been, who simply couldn't and even cannot
        find a solution to this huge problem. Art business bullying is simply a natural
        thing to happen in any brand new Industry that increased by thousands of %
        in the last 15 years. <br>If you are a class organizer, an Artist, a model,
        an Art Teacher, a School, a Business that had to give up, are about to or
        suffering permanently and even someone who can help, we are here to make you
        smile with a small team of good experienced people, advisers, helpers and
        authorities influencers. Don't we love to know what is really going on and
        Justice itself? This group is also open to everyone who'd rather know everything
        earlier rather than too later and avoid problems. <br>We will use zoom, or
        similar, for now and meet online originally then we can decide how to chat
        more. <br>There is no cost attached to this group as true Charity is always
        the Best way.<br></p>\\n<p>Here is what you all want to know, what is this
        Bullying all about, I'll try to make this Story as short as Possible...</p>\\n<p>In
        2003 after working in Photography for 10 years I saw the near extinction of
        Film photography and was aware of what our Digital age was changing. I was
        going to Life Drawing classes and realized that they were also going down
        the plug hole especially looking at the strict way things were run, how exploited
        life models were paid only about £3/h with a few weeks to 10 weeks contracts
        so they had to be there and they were literally crying at classes. This triggered
        something in me and I had to save the situation and started classes run completely
        differently at a third of what classes were and paid models&nbsp; X3. I then
        started doing classes everywhere in Pubs in London and started local networks
        and interest for it. I wasn't expecting to get models to start asking for
        the same salary everywhere but they did and the person who from being a Life
        model became the provider for Schools and Art teachers, simply could not find
        models to send to them for what they were paying before and Schools simply
        didn't have the ressources. I without knowing her, affected her Business in
        the worst possible way. She just about managed to survive and found tricks
        to be able to continue. From 2005 her main problem was me and she started
        to look for ways to get rid of me. She studied my business and realized that
        all was amazing and perfect except my writing of the English Language and
        so she used it, and started telling hundreds if not thousands already that
        Tony was unrespectfull for Women in general which is completely the opposite.
        She never stopped looking for ways until she made me a monster that had to
        be stopped and asked her community, by then, to give her a hand as it seemed
        to be true and so the bar would get raised and raised with more and more people
        doing things for her and anonymously contacting people I worked with, venues,
        sponsors and creating all sorts of made up proofs always raising the bar.
        Unfortunately she won't back down, it's too late and I won't either as I never
        done anything wrong. I just had an amazing success that could have ended up
        much bigger as no matter who people want to keep away from things like that
        rather than trying to find a truth. So for the next 20 years I'll be working
        20 times harder than anyone after already have worked really hard and been
        succesful at whatever my goals were. She calls that a Karma or is it just
        Bullying using woman's protection concept as an unbeatable weapon?&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Anyway
        I Love what I do and she knows that she has to keep or pretend to keep professional/business
        related attitude as we gathered so much info about each other that they are
        limits she knows and all the people doing favours to her know, that should
        not be passed. In fact she is going to help me bring Life Drawing to every
        Island, village, city in the World and the next, and the next.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>If
        anyone who is supporting her read this, I suggest you keep anonymous as you
        always did and change side also anonymously. We are dealing with one psychopath
        intelligent individual who simply used and will use all the tricks there is
        50/50 legal and illegal, might as well.</p>\\n<p>Any Artist, people who go
        to Life Drawing classes should just like me ignore all this and support me
        by pretending they know nothing and enjoy many happy Life Drawing classes
        every week.</p>\\n<p>Life models who believe in a just, fair world should
        come to me and gather whatever info can be used and i'll pay a reward or like
        her give you jobs if you are a good model obviously or able to follow instructions.</p>\\n<p>PS.
        Meetup after deleting my 12 groups in 2012, thanks to her abilities to make
        up stories professionally, now knows like a few other big companies they convinced
        at the time, they know that they had no choice but to over react without even
        being able to say why they did it at that time. I am now friend with them
        as they know how much damage she did and kkep on doing. Recently it was Youtube,
        at least one model a week gets scared away, Slendering posters were sent on
        Instagram to who knows how many people and always anonymously which works
        great for them as long as they can provide fake evidence that took them months
        to make look real, etc...</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;I am not using names here to keep
        things anonymous, my own way, and this should be used as reference and study/talk
        material for as many as possible as nothing that i know of can be done. All
        ideas are welcome and feel free to message me your story. BTW half of the
        members of this group are her spies or people who hope to become one so they
        can hopefully get paid to get naked... The Life Drawing world is very very
        very complicated...</p>\\n<p>Tony</p>\",\"created\":1613479320000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        month we will get together in a Central London pub to discuss a wonderful
        book most probably not about leopards (but one can dream). We will try to
        select books that aren't too long as we all have other books to read and maybe
        other fine book clubs to attend. </p>\\n<p>We will also avoid any books that
        rely on existing knowledge of other works or are incomplete. For instance,
        parts of a series will mostly (and sadly) have to be avoided and novel tie-ins
        to films or TV series are also unlikely as this would require familiarity
        with the original material.</p>\\n<p>We don't have a lot of rules, just be
        nice and respectful to everyone and don't talk over people. &nbsp;Also, please
        keep your RSVPs up to date. &nbsp;People doing last minute cancellations or
        no shows can leave us in a poor position with the venue and we wouldn't want
        to lose it!</p>\\n<p>Have you heard the Good News about George?&nbsp; We love
        the George and you should too.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp; And George.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Finally,
        being a book club, we are looking for fun discussions so we will try to find
        novels where there will be a good amount to talk about rather than everyone
        just oooing and aaahing about how awesome it was.</p>\\n<p>But yes, read book,
        chat about book... profit! If it works for the underpants gnomes it works
        for us yes? Huzzah!</p>\\n<p>If you'd like to suggest books, you can do so

        Stress is necessary to keep us alert and motivated, and it remains beneficial
        as long as we are in the driver's seat of life. Stress becomes a problem when
        we struggle to keep up with what is going on.</p> \\n<p>Stress is multi-faced,
        with effects ranging from sleepless nights, mild irritability and anxiety,
        to frustration, anger, and despair. Mindfulness-based exercises will help
        you focus on the present moment and reduce anxiety.</p> \\n<p>This meetup
        will help if you want to</p> \\n<p>- Explore ways to reduce daily stress and
        find support &lt;br&gt;- Learn to relax with mindfulness techniques &lt;br&gt;-
        Get tools to empower yourself to deal with life challenges &lt;br&gt;- Improve
        your confidence and communication skills to get the life you want &lt;br&gt;-
        Meet like-minded people and leave loneliness behind</p> \\n<p>The workshops
        are largely discussion-based and the mood is supportive, collaborative and
        non-judgemental. So everyone is encouraged to share their views and is listened

        no-show without a change in RSVP at least 24 hours in advance will result
        in membership review and possible removal. Please do not attempt to attend

        <br></p>\\n<p>FIFAPUB began as dream. We wanted to play big tournaments with

        have 1 TV or maybe 2 if somebody brings theirs. However how many people you
        can host at home? Wow, it sound great but it usually ends up being a real
        hassle. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p> <br>After more almost 2 years now, 194 tournaments,
        1200 registered players and an average of 20 people each night, we have decided
        to step up.&nbsp; <br> <br></p>\\n<p>Check our Facebook page to take a look

        - Action Adventure Activity</b></p>\\n<p>One of <b>London's most established

        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/e/event_431763806.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>To
        get outdoors and <b>visit new places, enjoy the beautiful scenery with people</b>
        who want to have fun and meet new friends. We have a simple philosophy; provide
        fun and sociable events that incorporate the best an area has to offer with
        experienced hike leaders. </p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/7/event_431763255.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>All
        the photos shown are taken on events by group members</b>...thank you to our
        talented group photographers Alex, the David's, Mike and many others..</p>\\n<p><b>Who
        are we?</b></p>\\n<p>We were <b>established in 2008</b> and have <b>run well
        over 500 events</b> and <b>hosted over 20,000 members</b>. We usually run
        around 50 events per year ranging from mid-week evening social events, such
        as treasure hunts and kayaking sessions, to weekend and the week-long UK and
        overseas hiking trips to Europe and beyond.</p>\\n<p>In <b>2018 we are proud
        to say that we ran events in over 35 different location</b>s covering the
        breadth of the UK from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands and from Pembrokeshire
        to Norfolk. In addition to this, we have hosted trips in over <b>8 different
        European locations</b> and we are <b>constantly striving to offer new and
        interesting trips</b>. We are confident in 2018 there will be even more events
        and places that we will be visiting.</p>\\n<p>The <b>AAA crew is made up</b>
        of a lot of <b>outdoor enthusiasts</b> with decades of experience, a number
        of our principal hike leaders originate from the <b>British Army</b> and a
        couple from the Russian Military <b>who all have extensive navigation, mountain
        and first aid experience. </b>So you'll be in steady hands! Your taste buds
        will also be very well catered for by our team of chefs, cooks and kitchen
        helpers.</p>\\n<p>AAA's mix of great food, capable hike leaders, interesting
        destination and inclusive social aspects has been very popular with our members,
        so popular that we are proud to recognise that other larger groups have now
        been replicating both our events and format and menus. We are indeed flattered
        by any imitation as the more groups offering trips is good for everyone and
        we hope one day to be in a position to flatter their achievements. </p>\\n<p>We
        for our part will still continue to <b>strive to provide popular destinations
        at affordable prices</b> with a <b>strong emphasis on providing good hikes,
        quality food and enjoyable and inclusive socialising</b>. You can also be
        assured that the events and activities we list are activities we have hosted
        and not just a marketing ploy, as adopted by the largest UK outdoor group.</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/d/event_431762749.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>Our
        most popular events are weekend hiking trips to locations around the UK.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>What
        makes our events?</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p>Without a doubt, the answer to this
        question is our members. We are proud of the fact that we regularly have over
        50% of our weekend and overseas trips made up of loyal members who have attended
        other trips. This is not to say that the group is cliquey in any way. As hosts,
        we have belonged to groups where cliques exist and we work hard with our members
        to ensure that this doesn't happen.</p>\\n<p>AAA has some basic principals
        for ensuring successful events. They are quite simply;</p>\\n<p>1. <b>Great
        Hiking Destinations</b>. If we are not interested in the destination, then
        we don't host a trip there. We also don't resist the same destination multiple
        times in the year just to host more trips than other groups.</p>\\n<p>2. <b>Quality
        accommodation is</b> suitable for the event.</p>\\n<p>3. Only using <b>Experienced
        Hike Leaders and or qualified instructors</b> for other activities</p>\\n<p>4.
        <b>Comprehensive Destination Research </b>which we always pre-visit before
        proposing an event.</p>\\n<p>5. <b>Control of the finances</b>, we don't use
        third-party operators on the ground to book transport and accommodation. We
        control the money, this reduces any risk of ground operators going into liquidation
        without the Meetup Group having any recourse. </p>\\n<p>6. <b>Control of the
        logistics.</b> If we don't have control of the finances we can't control the
        logistics. If we have control of the logistics it enables us to adjust the
        programme if needed.</p>\\n<p>7. <b>Social Hub.</b> Socialising is a big part
        of Meetup, after all its in the title! So wherever we are we look to ensure
        that there is a point where everyone can socialise, whether it be a dining
        room, local bar or lounge. </p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>Who attends our
        events?</b></p>\\n<p>The <b>majority of our active members range in age between
        the mid-20s to late 40s</b>, but age is no barrier so long as you are at least
        young at heart. Members generally live or work in the greater London area,
        but we have an <b>ever-increasing number of members who live all over the
        UK and join us in the destination</b>. After all, you don\\u2019t need to
        live in London to visit the Lake District!</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/6/event_431763238.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>A
        large proportion of our members are international, providing an interesting
        and diverse mix of experiences and cultures. We also have a significant proportion
        of single members on events, although you certainly don\\u2019t need to be
        single to attend. We have many couples attending our events.</p>\\n<p><b>If
        you are nervous about committing to a weekend trip, don't be, almost everyone
        has turned up on an event before without knowing anyone. We all know what
        it's like. </b> If you are still concerned try one of our evening or day events,
        they act as a taster and you are sure to meet like-minded people. We also
        work hard to ensure that the trips are inclusive for everyone. We usually
        provide a minimum of two hike leaders on weekend and overseas hikes to ensure
        we can offer a mix of hikes to meet the group's needs. We rarely have hikes
        that exceed 28 people and usually, the hikes are pitched a group of no more
        than 16 people of similar fitness and ability.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/2/event_431762930.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>What
        do we do?</b></p>\\n<p><b>We organise the logistics for our hiking trips so
        that you don\\u2019t have to</b>. We find the locations, book the venues and
        organise all catering for weekends. <b>We even help coordinate transport and
        lift shares. If you don't have transport contact the organiser who will help
        put you in contact with someone who's driving.</b></p>\\n<p><b>Our aim is
        to explore and hike in picturesque and beautiful rural locations throughout
        the British Isles and beyond</b>. We regularly visit all of the UK\\u2019s
        National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>\\n<p>Whilst we
        often repeat visits to the many great National Parks we do vary the locations
        we stay at as best as we can. W<b>e certainly don't repeat the same venues
        and walks over and over again just because we have a hike or hostel that works
        and is easy to repeat.</b> One look at our past events will show you the variety
        of places visited.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/5/event_431762837.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>EVENING
        SOCIALS</b></p>\\n<p>We arrange a host of evening events that usually provide
        an element of the activity. <b>We believe it's better to get people together
        and involved in an activity that they can participate in rather than just
        organising a Meetup in a pub.</b> However, we normally conclude our events
        with a social drink or two in a pub.</p>\\n<p>Evening events have included
        <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/#past\\\">(examples of
        our events can be viewed in our past events section)</a></p>\\n<p><b>Treasure
        &amp; Scavenger Hunts around London</b>, Go-Karting, Paintball, <b>Kayaking
        along the Thames</b>, Yoga, Shopping Discount evenings, Pub Quizzes, <b>Charitable
        Volunteering Events</b>, Games nights, <b>Orienteering</b> and Photography
        exhibitions.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/6/event_431762790.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>DAY
        HIKES AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES</b></p>\\n<p>We organise a number of day walks
        and activities throughout the year. These usually depart from a central London
        station and the hikes normally start at location 60-90 minutes outside of
        London in areas of scenic beauty. If you live close to the start of the hike
        let us know and join us there. <b>We look to organise everything, so all you
        need to do is turn up and we will have your tickets and everything ready.</b>
        Our hikes are led by very capable navigators with years of map reading experience.
        In fact one of our hike leaders spent most of his military life navigating
        at night, so he's relieved to be allowed out navigating during the daylight
        hour!</p>\\n<p>We also organise other events such as;</p>\\n<p><b>Kayaking
        on the Cuckmere and into the sea</b>, Go Ape, Go-karting, canoeing the River
        Wye, <b>caving</b>, climbing &amp; abseiling, <b>zip wires</b>, London's Lord
        Mayors Show, <b>navigation training </b>and even photography sessions.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>HIKING
        AND ACTIVITY WEEKENDS</b></p>\\n<p>Typically we organise two or more weekends
        per month in all parts of the UK. Trips usually involve a visit to the National
        Park or an Area of Natural Beauty throughout the UK. Sometimes we organise
        optional activities that can range from Yoga to cycling. Since 2013 we have
        included even more climbing &amp; Abseiling, Caving, Canoeing, Scrambling,
        Kayaking, Surfing and Wine Tasting. But nothing is off-limits so if you have
        an idea let us know.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/d/event_431762957.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>Normally
        we hire for <b>exclusive use of a Youth Hostel or similar accommodation,</b>
        sometimes it can be a hotel or lodge. <b>AAA almost always host the breakfast
        and evening meals</b> as we are very particular about maintaining out a reputation
        for providing quality food on our weekends. We will be there to greet you
        on arrival and allocate rooms etc. There is <b>always a warm supper on a Friday
        night followed by some cake</b>. The weekends then take on a well-rehearsed
        routine that ensures we can maximize on the time for hiking.</p>\\n<p>We try
        where possible not to repeat weekends and if we do we do so in different seasons.
        However, some locations like Snowdon and the Brecon Beacons are always very
        popular and worth repeating. But unlike some groups, you won't find us visiting
        the same location twice or more in the same month. As organisers, we have
        a passion for the outdoors and too much repetition is a bad thing.</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/8/event_431762856.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>OVERSEAS
        TRIPS</b></p>\\n<p>We enjoy experiencing new places and we are sure you do,
        too. So we are always looking to host hiking orientated trips in new overseas
        locations. We typically organise the accommodation, catering etc as well as
        plan with detail the hikes in the local areas. Often we will pick you up from
        the local airport or provide you with details to organise your own transfers
        to the accommodation. We will even recommend flights and help you coordinate
        your travel arrangements with others in the group.</p>\\n<p>When we are in
        the location we help to facilitate additional activities from mountain biking,
        paragliding, white water rafting to a wine tasting or local sightseeing trips.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>Who
        are we?</b></p>\\n<p>Our core team have a wealth of experience in a wide variety
        of key areas. We have years of hiking and outdoors experience. O<b>ur principal
        events hosts and hike leaders have over three decades of military experience,
        two from elite units</b> (certainly not in the catering corp.) as well as
        a <b>15-year career in the event management industry</b> producing events
        from small high-end events to logistics for 15,000 person event. <b>One of
        our event hosts has even won awards in the event industry</b>. Not content
        with our existing experience we also undertake additional training to keep
        our key skills tip-top.</p>\\n<p>Click here to <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/pages/AAA_London_Group_crew/\\\">Meet
        the team</a></p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>Why do we do it?</b></p>\\n<p><b>Quite
        simply we love the outdoors and making the most of this beautiful country
        we live in and what better way to do it than by meeting new friends.</b></p>\\n<p><b>Our
        aim is to build a great community of hikers with whom we can share our enjoyment
        of the outdoors and adventurous activities. As they say, size isn't important!
        </b>We are never happier than when we see the same members repeatedly attend
        our events, many have been joining us for years and we continue to enjoy their
        company.</p>\\n<p>Many of our members have made new lifelong friends after
        trips, some have developed into loving relationships and we know of at least
        three couples that have met and got married after meeting on our events.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><img
        src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/1/event_431763281.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p><b>How
        do we do it?</b></p>\\n<p>We create appealing trips that are affordable to
        all. They are affordable because we generally use Youth Hostels and cater
        for ourselves and everyone helps and contributes towards the weekend.</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><a

        food you enjoy has been said by many to be the best they have experience on
        any Meetup event.</b> We strive to ensure we provide a <b>cooked breakfast</b>,
        not just a cold continental buffet, after all if you are setting off on a
        day's hike you want a hearty meal. We set everything up in the morning for
        you to make your own <b>sandwiches with fillings of your own choice</b>. AAA
        dinner is always very popular with wholesome ingredients including a variety
        of salads, vegetarian dishes as well a typical main selection followed by
        a cake for dessert. After supper, we all get to relax and socialise, sometimes
        with some games, whichever is most fitting. Whilst we all enjoy a pub visit,
        <b>we include the dinner within the cost</b>, so it's not an extra cost or
        a car journey (with no alcohol!).</p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b><a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/pages/20448201/AAA_Frequently_Asked_Questions/\\\">Frequently
        Asked Questions</a></b></p>\\n<p>Many people ask us questions about our trips,
        we hope that we cover most of the usual questions in the event description.
        We also have some answers to the popular question in our <a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/pages/20448201/AAA_Frequently_Asked_Questions/\\\">FAQ
        section</a></p>\\n<p><b> &lt;br&gt;</b></p>\\n<p><b>Safety</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p>Our
        main hike leaders have <b>undertaken the six-day Mountain Leader course (accredited
        by the MLT) </b>as well as having <b>undertaken the two and three day Wilderness
        &amp; Outdoor Activity First Aid course</b>. One of our hike leaders even
        undertook a 6-month military-medical course culminating with practical training
        in an A&amp;E Hospital and 2 weeks with paramedics. Both of <b>our principal
        hike leaders have over 20 years of military experience, </b>not just as conscripts.
        Much of their experience was focused on fieldcraft, navigation and first aid,
        making them ideal hike leaders. </p>\\n<p>All of our events are run by very
        experienced hikers, most of our hike leaders have a minimum of Mountain Leader
        training and an Outdoor Activity First Aid qualification or similar experience/qualifications.
        It would, however, be unfair to say that this makes the outdoors safe, there
        is always risks present, but with our experience, training and meticulous
        planning, we aim to minimise the risk.</p>\\n<p>Generally, our hikes tend
        to be limited to 20 people when in the hills and 24-28 in lowlands as our
        training indicate that this is a safe number, it's also important for everyone's
        enjoyment that the hike is not hindered by big numbers, or a very slow pace
        as you constantly find yourself waiting and it prevents people getting left
        behind, as we hear so often occurs in other groups with 40-50 people on a
        day hike. </p>\\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p><b>What type of activities do we do?</b></p>\\n<p>Over
        the past three years, we have offered a wide range of events. These have included;</p>\\n<p><b>Hiking
        &amp; walking</b> (of course), kayaking along the Thames, <b>camping &amp;
        canoeing</b>, yoga breaks, fitness weekends, potholing, <b>historic sightseeing,

        we're about?</strong></p>\\n<p> <br>A group of people dedicated and committed
        to making the great outdoors more accessible to everyone. With over 28,000
        members, we have now organised over 700 hiking trips including day walks,
        weekend hiking trips and an increasing range of foreign hiking trips travelling
        to Europe and beyond for adventure travel holidays.<br></p>\\n<p><br>Between
        our 3 most senior hike leaders we have over 50 years of experience of leading
        hikes across the UK as well as an ever increasing range of international trips
        and tours. We have every corner of the UK covered from Snowdonia in Wales
        to the Lake District, the great Scottish Highlands and even the far off corners
        like Cornwall.<br><br>Please do take a look at our (over 400) independent
        group reviews:<br><br><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all\\\">http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all</a><br><br><a

        have 47 different day and weekend trips that have all been pre hiked and meticulously
        planned. We organise all the logistics for our hiking trips so that you can
        just turn up, walk and have a great time and meet new people while enjoying
        the great outdoors.<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/6/event_433336358.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/6/event_433336358.jpeg</a><br><br>If
        you enjoy hiking and are based in the UK, Outdooraholics is for you and we
        look forward to welcoming you to the group!</p>\\n<p>How did we start up<br><br>The
        original group Minty Trips was started in July 2008 by Eva and Jakub who came
        to England from the Czech Republic, they gained an awesome reputation for
        superb and well organised trips and Outdooraholics are delighted to continue
        their good work. Jakub and Eva say:<br>\\\"Organizing great outdoor adventures
        and meeting new friends, we both enjoyed hiking in Lake District and Snowdonia
        and relaxing strolls in Cornwall or Dorset. Now going through all those photos
        and memories, we truly loved every trip and feel very fortunate to have met
        so many wonderful people. In 2013, leaving the UK, we were glad to transfer
        our group to experienced organizers of Outdooraholics. We can now be contacted
        via email on&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/b/8/event_433336312.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/b/8/event_433336312.jpeg</a><br><br>Most
        of our members generally either live or work in London, although we have people
        from all over the UK attending and we've had several people visit from abroad
        for our trips and join us at our destination. After all you don't need to
        live in London to visit Cornwall, Wales or the Lake District!<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/f/3/event_433336371.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/f/3/event_433336371.jpeg</a><br><br>We
        have a lot of international members - either here on work placements or to
        live and this brings a superb cultural variety and mix of life experiences
        to the group and helps to make our trips so interesting and diverse.<br><br><a
        href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/2/event_433336146.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/2/event_433336146.jpeg</a><br><br>We
        get a lot of people who attend their first event on their own and we always
        go out of our way to make everyone very welcome on our trips. They have proven
        to be a great way to meet people as well as to see this wonderful island<br><br><a
        href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/b/0/600_437192176.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/b/0/600_437192176.jpeg</a><br><br>Can
        I really turn up alone?<br><br>Yes of course - most people do! Please don't
        be nervous about attending your first event - we have all been in the same
        boat at some point of turning up at an event alone and knowing nobody. To
        help introduce people to the group and indeed hiking we have designed 27 different
        hiking day trips which are a superb way to come and meet the group and we
        can assure you of a very warm welcome whatever event you choose and there
        are bound to be others who are attending their first event too. Hiking is
        a great way of meeting like minded people whilst keeping fit and seeing wonderful
        places too.<br><br>If you are nervous about committing to a weekend trip,
        please don't be, almost everyone has turned up to an event before without
        knowing anyone and we all know what it's like. To help new members into the
        group we run 4 to 6 day trips a month which are an easy and low cost way to
        try our events.<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/d/event_433336157.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/1/d/event_433336157.jpeg</a><br><br>What
        hiking trips do we organise?<br><br>Day hikes<br>We organise typically 6 to
        8 day hiking trips a month and have 27 tried and tested routes that we use
        from London. All are pre walked and are picturesque routes that we carefully
        choose. All trips leave from a central London station and we arrange train
        tickets, so you can just turn up and enjoy a great day out with us.<br><br><a
        href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/4/9/event_433336201.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/4/9/event_433336201.jpeg</a><br><br>Weekend
        hiking trips<br>We organise 3 to 6 weekend trips a month to all corners of
        the UK, showing you the very best that this country has to offer. We typically
        rent an entire Youth Hostel just for our group and after a great days hiking
        then either go to a local restaurant or cook at the hostel. We have over 18
        different weekend trips and are adding new ones all the time!<br><br>We have
        a professionally trained chef who joins many of our trips and we regularly
        visit all of the UK's National Parks and designated \\\"Areas of Outstanding
        Natural Beauty\\\"<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/1/event_433336209.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/1/event_433336209.jpeg</a><br><br>Trips
        abroad<br>We offer an ever increasing variety of trips from 3 nights up to
        a week and will be having a number of new trips added in 2018. Where possible
        we aim for twin bed rooms and put the meticulous planning into our foreign
        trips so that you can have a great time and get to see the best of the area
        that you're visiting. It is a legal requirement (as well as advisable for
        safety) in many foreign mountainous locations to have an internationally qualified
        guide and for many of our foreign trips we have a local or native speaking
        guide.<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/6/9/event_433336233.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/6/9/event_433336233.jpeg</a><br><br><a

        several pub socials per year in central London locations as well as discount
        nights at outdoor stores in central London.<br><br>We do focus on the outdoor

        do we do it?<br><br>Quite simply - we all share a passion for the great outdoors
        and with all of our trip leaders being born and raised in the UK with a life
        long love of hiking, we can't wait to show you this great country!<br><br>We
        have so many wonderful experiences on our trips and many people have found
        a new love of the outdoors, met their partners through Outdooraholics and
        made what are likely to be lifelong friendships.<br><br>Our organisers can't
        wait to show you this great country and why we all developed such a lifelong
        love of hiking here all those decades ago<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/b/0/event_433336048.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/b/0/event_433336048.jpeg</a><br><br>Yoga
        health and wellness retreats<br><br>We offer a range of superb value yoga
        retreats in the UK, which we call Yogaholics trips. We take your safety and
        the great reputation of our yoga/hiking trips very seriously and we only ever
        use professional full time yoga instructors. We also typically have a professional
        chef to ensure we have wonderful, healthy and revitalising food. We follow
        the same great formula as with our hiking weekends - great organisation, great
        home cooked food, pre planned and hiked routes and highly experienced hike
        leaders and using hostels allows us to do this at a great price too. We look
        forward to bringing you an even more expanded range of Yogaholics trips as
        we enter our 4th year of these Yogaholics trips in 2015!<br><br>We have created
        a great range of hostel based yoga trips on this wonderful concept, but if
        you would like more luxury hiking/yoga trips also run by a professional yoga
        instructor, we can highly recommend the excellent Yoga Trails:<br><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/yogatrails/\\\">http://www.meetup.com/yogatrails/</a><br><br>Why
        Outdooraholics?<br><br>A very good question. There are some superb London
        based walking groups on Meetup - Backabush are well known for over a decade
        of organising superb hiking weekends and brought the whole concept of great
        value hiking trips to Meetup and Trailblazer have been organising an excellent
        and huge range of days hikes for over 5 years now. Both groups we highly recommend
        and regularly hear great things about their trips and both have inspired many
        other groups to offer similar events to theirs. 1000 Foot Hiking club is also
        highly recommended - run by some inspirational people on a non profit basis
        with all money raised going to a water aid charity.<br><br>Except for Outdooraholics
        most of the major London hiking groups on Meetup have evolved out of Backabush
        and Trailblazer and generally run the same format as their trips. Whilst we'd
        be lying if we said we weren't inspired by the great trips these groups run,
        we wanted to do something different and new and created Outdooraholics from
        scratch and we believe giving our trips a quite different flavour. We took
        a very simple idea as our basis - of organising all of the logistics for our
        hiking trips so that you don't have to. We advise you what to bring, you turn
        up and you'll have a great time. All of our trips are run by trip leaders
        from that particular country so we believe they can show you the country and
        culture like only a local can. We organise an equal mix of day hikes and weekend
        trips and put the same detailed planning into both.<br><br>We also try to
        use local tour guides for the majority of our trips so that you can get a
        proper insight in to the history, culture and country that you're visiting
        - after all you wouldn't expect to visit Russia for example and be \\\"shown\\\"
        the country and it's cultures by a British person!<br><br>We plan all of our
        trips in advance including the routes that we take to ensure that we show
        you the best of an area and also that we know what the risks are on the tracks
        and indeed that the trails are passable and safe. All of the photos on our
        trips are taken by one of our hike leaders, from that trip, on the paths that
        you will actually be hiking so that you can best decide which trips appeal
        to you. The great outdoors does carry risks which is why we pre walk and plan
        all of our routes and trips.<br><br>We believe we offer the most diverse range
        of both day hikes and weekend trips available in the UK.<br><br>We only offer
        superb trips and we even have a professional chef who joins us on many of
        our weekend trips to offer great food, which is much appreciated after a tough
        days hiking.<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/7/4/event_433336244.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/7/4/event_433336244.jpeg</a><br><br>Safety<br><br>Our

        Leader (<a href=\\\"http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award\\\">http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award</a>)
        course (also accredited by the MLT) as well as having a two day outdoor Activity
        First Aid course and over 20 years of extensive and diverse hiking and leading
        experience. All of our trips are run by very experienced hikers with Outdoor
        Activity First Aid qualifications and most of our trip leaders are a minimum
        of Mountain Leader trained with 2 of our trip leaders having a military background.
        Sadly the outdoors always presents risks but through our experience, training
        and careful planning as well as pre planning and walking all of our routes
        we do our best to minimise those.<br><br><a href=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/5/4/event_432719220.jpeg\\\">https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/5/4/event_432719220.jpeg</a><br><br>Further

        enjoyment of people attending our trips is paramount. You don't have to be
        based in the South East or London as we have a demand for people in all locations.

        did we start up</strong></span></p>\\n<p>The original group Minty Trips was
        started in July 2008 by Eva and Jakub who came to England from the Czech Republic,
        they gained an awesome reputation for superb and well organised trips in smaller
        groups and Outdooraholics are delighted to continue their good work. Jakub
        and Eva say: <br> \\\"Organizing great outdoor adventures and meeting new
        friends, we both enjoyed hiking in Lake District and Snowdonia and relaxing
        strolls in Cornwall or Dorset. Now going through all those photos and memories,
        we truly loved every trip and feel very fortunate to have met so many wonderful
        people. In 2013, leaving the UK, we were glad to transfer our group to experienced
        organizers of Outdooraholics. We can now be contacted via email on <a href=\\\"mailto:info@mintytrips.co.uk\\\">info@mintytrips.co.uk</a>
        or maybe one day see you in Prague in the Czech Republic.\\\"</p>\",\"created\":1215972412000,\"city\":\"Manchester\",\"untranslated_city\":\"Manchester\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        a born and bred Londoner I started out as a toddler on a tricycle. In between
        freestyling in skate parks around London; I used to compete in BMX races as
        a child long before it became an Olympic sport, partly inspired by two childhood
        friends who happened to be British number ones. In some BMX race events I
        was back on three wheels again as a sidehack co pilot. More recent BMX encounters
        include owning an adult sized cruiser class that evokes golden memories. I
        currently ride on various terrains such as technical mountain biking, coastal,
        forests, urban city mixed with canal and river paths plus smooth country lanes
        with challenging hills. I have taken ride leader training with the London
        Cycling Campaign plus wilderness first aid instruction at the University of
        London Union and carry an emergency care kit on rides. I have arranged diverse
        activities for many organisations including education providers such as an
        American summer camp and university societies. <br></p>\\n<p>Jonathan</p>\\n<p>@Jon3i</p>\",\"created\":1392974503000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        sociable group? Come exploring with us!<br><br>Our members range from smartphone
        users to professional photographers, all with a shared interest in photography,
        meeting new people, and exploring different aspects of London and beyond.
        Our events don\\u2019t typically have set themes, as we prefer to explore
        a diverse range of interests.<br><br>Our events are suitable for photography
        enthusiasts of all levels. We hold regular weekend events usually consisting
        of one of the below:<br>- Photowalks<br>- London based festivals and events<br><span>-
        Day trips outside London<br></span><span>- Fun mini workshops<br></span><span>-
        Weekend trips to Europe<br></span><span>- Socials!</span></p>\\n<p>We're a
        very friendly and diverse group, which is important, as photography is best
        enjoyed with other people! We finish up most events in a pub or cafe to catch
        up afterwards and look at each other's photos, share advice, eat, play games
        etc. The groups are always a mixture of regulars and newcomers, so everyone's
        welcome!<br><br>Please note that we ask for voluntary donations of a couple
        of pounds for some events. This is purely to cover the cost of running the
        group, and we do not make a profit from our members.&nbsp;<br><br><b>A few
        rules:</b></p>\\n<p>Be aware that you are responsible for your own safety
        and belongings during our events. Some of our meetups involve being near wild
        animals, hiking, busy roads etc so please be mindful while engaging in these
        activities.</p>\\n<p>We usually leave the meeting place&nbsp;around 15&nbsp;minutes
        after the start time stated on the event page. This gives people a little
        bit of flexibility if they are running late. If you think you will be more
        than 15 minutes late to an event, just send a message and we may be able to
        wait, or meet you in another location. We always share our live location on
        Google Maps on the day so you can find us throughout the event.</p>\\n<p>It
        is very useful for us to know numbers in advance so we know who to wait for
        and so on. Therefore, please RSVP to events to let us know you are coming
        where possible. If you sign up to an event but realise that you can\\u2019t
        make it, please update your status to \\u2018not going\\u2019 as far in advance
        as you can.</p>\\n<p>This group is not to be used for self-promotion, or for
        recruiting group members for your own purposes.<br><br>Please avoid taking
        photos of children - not specifically a Simple Street Photography rule, but
        generally good advice.<br><br>Please only post a small selection of your photos
        from each event; 5-10 is recommended as it is difficult to navigate the photos
        on the meetup app when there are too many. You can share more photos on our
        Flickr or Facebook groups</p>\\n<p><br>Please respect other group members
        and their photography. For example, avoid blocking their shots or getting
        in their way, and refrain from any abusive behaviour.<br><br>Note: Meetup
        sends out a lot of notification and reminder emails; if these bother you,
        then please update your notification settings to reduce the number of emails
        sent on behalf of this group.</p>\",\"created\":1375905204000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        to help us innovate and start new businesses closer to where we live, in our
        beautiful borough bringing in the wider West London and Thames Valley networks.
        We will meet monthly in the warm and friendly Cricketers pub by the Richmond

        All Love To Bikes are set in the magnificent countryside to the south west
        and south east of London, and always start and finish at a train station.
        Love to Bikes range from 30 to 60 miles (50 to 100 kilometres) depending on
        the terrain, conditions and time of year. We ride at a sensible, continuous
        pace and lunch is usually at a pub. Estimated finish and train times are always

        at times can be wet and muddy. Love To Bikers must also have the skills and

        but normally we have two walks every month: one is a half-day walk, usually
        in one of the greener parts of Greater London, and the other is a full-day
        walk, usually in the countryside but mostly within an hour\\u2019s train journey
        from central London. On the full-day walks we normally stop at a pub or café
        for lunch, but you can bring a picnic if you prefer.</p>\\n<p>We welcome people
        of any age, and walk at a comfortable pace. All our walks can be reached by
        public transport. We also try to include parking information for drivers.</p>\\n<p>Although
        (as our name suggests) most of our walks are on Sundays, some are on Saturdays,
        and occasionally on a Bank Holiday Monday.</p>\\n<p>Please note that we are
        an independent organisation that exists outside of Meetup; this page is our
        \\\"shop window\\\" to help people find us.</p>\\n<p>Please do not be put
        off coming on a walk if there is only a small number of attendees shown on
        Meetup; there will be others on the walk who aren't on Meetup. Usually we
        get between 10 and 25 people per walk - enough to be sociable, but not so
        many that it's overwhelming!</p>\\n<p>You are welcome to come on up to 3 walks
        free to try out the group, but if you decide to come on more than that you
        will need to fill in a membership form and pay the membership fee, currently
        £11 a year (or £13 if you want to receive information by post not email).
        To find out how to do this, please go to <a href=\\\"http://www.gswg.org.uk\\\">www.gswg.org.uk</a>
        and click on \\\"How to Join\\\" at the top of the page; alternatively you
        can email us at gswg@hotmail.com to ask for a form. The membership fee goes
        towards the running costs of the group; none of the committee or walk leaders
        is paid.</p>\\n<p>Once you've paid the membership fee, we'll send you full

        focus on a specific country culture, bringing the most remarkable cultural
        aspects from a country. These will allow participants to exchange culture

        pub quiz runs as the usual English format with the spice up that the questions
        are raised in Spanish and English by a native speaker. The answers have to
        be in the second language as well. The host organises groups of four or five
        people.&nbsp; The host balances the Spanish/English level per group. There
        are rewards for first and second places.</p>\\n<p>Singles Night</p>\\n<p>This

        to Chiltern Explorers a walking social group aiming to do a wide range of
        guided walks across the Chilterns and further afield exploring other fantastic
        British countryside.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/3/a/600_454389018.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>Most
        of our walks start at a convenient tube or railway station and aim to get
        the best deals on any group save tickets for trains and try when possible
        to look for free car parking giving you as many travel options as possible.
        <br> <br>All our walks are well researched, leaving you free to relax and
        enjoy the lovely scenery or urban views in the company of other like-minded
        individuals and of course you will be keeping fit. Most walks end with a well-deserved
        pub stop with a strong social ethos.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/c/600_454389036.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>The
        walks are very varied with a relaxed feel, mainly around ten miles and at
        the weekend but some short walks from seven miles to longer faster paced walks
        of up to 20 miles and some mid-week walks. We are enthusiastic about photography
        and encourage sightseeing. <br> <br>We are twined with a more city urban walking
        group <b><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/London-Explorers/\\\">London Explorers</a>
        </b>and often do events together. Chiltern explorers is based to the west
        of London in the gorgeous Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)
        and also does a wide range of&nbsp; weekends away to other UK National Parks
        and other AONBs.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/5/c/600_454389052.jpeg\\\"></p>\\n<p>Chiltern
        Explorers is unusual for many outdoor meetup groups in that it currently only
        arranges the walks and leaves the accommodation up to the members giving members
        the option to go on the days they want and stay according to their budget,
        many members also car share for trips away. The weekends have a good social
        atmosphere and comradery. <br> <br>The country walks have covered the Chiltern

        walks and cycle rides are free to members. Trips away are run at cost (eg

        makes them super-cheap compared with events run by commercial outfits with
        paid organisers - CLOG is run entirely by volunteers.</p>\\n<p>CLOG Is for
        for people Interested in walking, cycling, hillwalking, kayaking, adventure

        (mountains, coasts, National Parks and other areas that are less easy to reach

        are run at cost (to pay for food and accommodation) or sometimes subsidised.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Walking,
        hillwalking, cycling and trips away are our main activities, but we also offer

        meeting creative people in the local area or just having a laugh, then this
        group is for YOU!</p>\\n<p>Improv is the art of collaboratively creating theatre
        in the moment. It can be dramatic, it can be funny (it doesn't have to be!),
        it can be emotional, it can be musical, it can be anything! It's brilliant
        to behold and it's liberating to do. There's no wonder its taking the world
        by storm at the moment. It's a fast growing scene in London and Brighton right
        now but there's not much improv in between the two cities. This is where we
        come in!</p>\\n<p>There's a great variety of ways you can become involved
        with 'The improv community of Sussex and Surrey'...</p>\\n<p>- Join us in
        our Zoom improv workshops from anywhere across the globe.</p>\\n<p>- We meetup
        in Horley and Crawley at least once a week to practice improvisational theatre
        techniques in fun and supportive workshops. (Currently postponed for obvius
        reasons)</p>\\n<p>- Participants of these workshops have the option to become
        involved in showcases in local theatres. These are really fun to be in or
        to watch</p>\\n<p>- We're always going on trips to see improv shows in London,
        Brighton or anywhere in between.</p>\\n<p>- Then there's all our other social
        events (in the pub mostly)</p>\\n<p>We sail under the banner of 'Dingbats

        and Pint is a warm and friendly social group for writers and non-writers alike.
        </p>\\n<p>It's a relaxed creative writing workshop and a great opportunity
        to get to know new people by sharing creative ideas over a drink ( ... or
        two).</p>\\n<p>We hold our sessions once a week in the upstairs room of one
        of London\\u2019s most historic and characterful pubs.</p>\\n<p>Come inside
        (6:30pm) and get yourself a drink at the bar. Make your way upstairs and find
        a seat (7:00pm). Say hello to some lovely people, help yourself to the free
        snacks, then get out your notebook and pen and let the ideas flow with the
        beer/wine/lime and soda.</p>\\n<p>Your session leader, Sean, is an experienced
        creative writing teacher with a degree in creative writing, a masters in literature,
        and fair bit of experience drinking good beer! </p>\\n<p>Sean will take you
        through a series of quick, fun writing games and exercises that will help
        your writing flow.</p>\\n<p>You\\u2019ll never have to read your work in front
        of the group. You can just relax. The focus here is on fun. </p>\\n<p>If you're
        a serious writer, the sessions are also great for finding new inspiration
        and mining for new ideas.</p>\\n<p>But no previous experience of writing is
        necessary. So if you haven\\u2019t put pen to paper in a creative way since
        primary school, this group is for you, too. </p>\\n<p>At the end of each session
        you\\u2019ll go home with that lovely warm feeling that comes from sharing
        a drink and some new ideas among friends. </p>\\n<p>You\\u2019ll also have
        a free Penguin book to take home with you to give you extra inspiration between
        sessions.</p>\\n<p>If you like, you can even join the crew afterwards for
        a drink and a chat in the pub downstairs before you go home. </p>\\n<p>Can\\u2019t
        wait to see you there.</p>\\n<p>Cheers!</p>\",\"created\":1533810893000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        \\n<p>******</p> \\n<p>This is a friendly, brand new book club for ladies
        in Cumbria.</p> \\n<p>The club is inspired by by The London Girly Book Club
        (although not an official branch).</p> \\n<p>It's a club for female fiction
        lovers to gather to discuss interesting books and, just as importantly, have
        a good giggle - often cocktails, wine or cake are involved. </p> \\n<p>The
        books on the reading list are not as 'heavy' as many book clubs. The odd classic
        will make it on the list but in general the books are easy going with universal
        appeal.</p> \\n<p>Message from the host:</p> \\n<p>I've just moved to Cockermouth
        and can't find a replacement for The Girly Book Club that I was a member of
        in London. There must be other like minded ladies looking for a similar social
        group so I've decided to launch a branch of book club in Cumbria. </p> \\n<p>The
        meetings will be free and on a weekday evening and held in a nice pub/bar
        that we can reserve a suitable area in. I suggest alternating the meetings
        between Cockermouth, Keswick and Grasmere initially as that covers a reasonably
        wide catchment area. </p> \\n<p>To make life easy, we'll use the official
        Girly Book Club's reading list for the first 3 months and then take a members
        vote about bringing in local authors or going marvick! So - if this sounds
        like your kind of club, press the join button now! Anyone keen to get involved
        in the organising, drop me a message. It's not a lot of work but some local
        knowledge on venues could come in handy for a Cumbria newbie! Happy reading
        and hope to meet you soon. Kate &lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\",\"created\":1427922094000,\"city\":\"Keswick\",\"untranslated_city\":\"Keswick\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        I started this group quite a while ago (ahem), but had to put it on hold because
        of other life commitments, injuries, operations and a house move out of London.
        The group will start up again in late September/early October 2019.<span><br></span><span><br></span>This
        group is for you if you yearn to spend more (or any) time outdoors, exploring
        the countryside. We will meet once a month on average, to do a day-long walk
        easily accessible by train from London and Brighton, where I now live. If
        time allows and people are keen, we'll aim to have lunch or end each walk
        in a pub or cafe, before we all head home. <span><br></span><span><br></span>This
        group is aimed predominantly at women over 40, those who have walking experience
        but no-one to walk with (i.e., you have friends whose eyes glaze over at the
        prospect of a day outside of an urban setting), as well as novice walkers.
        This group will be all-inclusive and I'd particularly like to encourage black
        and ethnic minority women to come along and get outdoors. Walks will be of
        varying levels of difficulty, but will start off fairly short and easy as
        we head into the shorter autumn days. My vision for this group is to create
        a friendly, inviting, all-inclusive group of women who love walking and the
        outdoors, and are also up for trying new things, such as SUP (stand up paddleboard),
        kayaking or camping. Dogs are welcome, but they must be kept on a leash, or
        be comfortable and relaxed around horses, sheep and cows.<span><br></span><span><br></span>DISCLAIMER:
        I love being outdoors and I want to share the experiences with like-minded
        ladies, so my motives are (almost) entirely selfish. However, I am NOT a qualified
        walking guide, and so, you are responsible for your own safety. This means
        that you will be fairly self-reliant, you will bring along a copy of any route
        directions I share and will aim to use them.&nbsp;<span><br></span></p>\",\"created\":1371653320000,\"city\":\"London\",\"untranslated_city\":\"London\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        As Associate members of the Rotary Club of Epsom we follow the Rotary motto
        of \\u201cService Above Self\\u201d but do so in a way which fits with the
        busy lifestyle of young professionals (late 20s plus) and families, with flexibility
        and affordability being key. Epsom Rotary Associates is about community, charity,
        fun and friendship.</p>\\n<p>Each year we are involved in a range of community
        events. These currently include a conservation weekend with the National Trust
        and volunteering at the Rotary Club of Epsom\\u2019s Christmas collections.<br></p>\\n<p>We
        have a varied social calendar with past events including pub quizzes, picnics,
        pub socials, wine tasting, drinks and dinner in Central London, a games evening
        and walks. <br></p>\\n<p>In April 2017 we organised a charity quiz night and
        raised £1323.32 for the purchase of dementia blankets and other equipment
        for wards to help dementia patients. In 2016 we donated £750 to The Sunnybank

        Great Anglo-Basque Hiking Company create and lead hikes with an emphasis on
        fun, fitness, fresh air, inclusiveness and 'high-fiving' good old Mother Nature!
        Our routes, typically 12 to 20 miles in length, are created by ourselves and
        favour variety and the lesser trodden paths (that magically always lead to
        a great pub at the end!).</span><br></p>\\n<p>We hike with a sense of fun
        and adventure in our heart, but we always hike responsibly. We are a not-for-profit
        group, with 25% of our meetup fees going to <a href=\\\"http://www.wiltshiremind.co.uk/about-us/\\\"></a><a
        href=\\\"https://www.dementiauk.org/\\\">Dementia UK</a> (who provide needed
        compassionate one-to-one support, guidance and practical solutions for people
        with dementia and their families) and the remainder goes to covering our operating
        costs, meetup fees and public liability insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are as such
        not a company in the business sense, be we do aim to be great company!</p>\\n<p><b>Our
        hikes:</b></p>\\n<p>The majority of our hikes are day hikes within travelling
        distance of London but we, from time to time, organise special long weekend
        hikes across the UK and Northern Spain (including of course the most wonderful
        Basque Country). Our hikes always include a good dose of hills and always
        end at a great pub (or taverna), where we have plenty of opportunity to regale
        our hiking tales over a few ice cold beers. Our pace is always good to brisk.
        Our routes are created by ourselves from scratch (never copied from the internet!)
        and we always vary them in some way or another to make each hike unique in
        its own special way. Aaaaah.</p>\\n<p><b>About Elsa and Bill:</b></p>\\n<p>We
        are a couple of competent, communicative, positive and fun individuals with
        plenty of experience leading successful hikes. We love to hike and very much
        appreciate the beauty and beneficial nature of the Great Outdoors. Hiking
        is in Bill's family heritage (hence the surname \U0001F609) and Elsa grew
        up hiking in the beautiful Basque Country mountains that surround the medieval
        village she was born in. </p>\\n<p><b>About our fellow organisers:</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\\n<p>Our
        five fellow organisers really are the embodiment of the diverse, inclusive,
        friendly, fun and welcoming nature of the Great Anglo-Basque Hiking Company.
        They not only have plenty of hiking experience and tales between them, they
        have real character to go with it too!</p>\\n<p><b>Health and Safety:</b>
        <br></p>\\n<p>Our hikes will be organised and operated in alignment with prevailing
        UK Government restrictions and recommendations relating to COVID-19 and in
        accordance with our Day Hike COVID-19 Risk Assessment. COVID-19 related requirements
        will be communicated via email and Event Comments prior to the event and Event
        Organisers/Hike Leader will issue reminders and perform specific safety checks
        on the day of hike. Of course it is fully expected that if anyone feels unwell
        or has symptoms of COVID-19 they should NOT attend events.</p>\\n<p>The&nbsp;Great
        Anglo-Basque Hiking Company has a current Public Liability Insurance policy.</p>\\n<p><b><i>Gora

        to create a truly social experience centred around candid street photography.
        The purpose of the meetup is purely social: meeting each others to learn from
        one another, and share our common passion for candid, unstaged street photography.
        </p>\\n<p>Are you ready to explore the streets of London? If so, please join
        us during one of our future photowalks! We'll organise photowalks in central
        London, which will end with a social meetup in a nearby pub to share our experiences
        and images. Oh, and it will be free (or nearly free to cover monthly admin
        fees) because social photography shouldn't mean we have to pay to meet friends
        :)</p>\\n<p>Do you want to lead photowalks with this group? Just let me know,
        and I'll set you up. I look forward to meeting all of you, and to capture

        Together\",\"status\":\"active\",\"link\":\"https://www.meetup.com/WriteTogether/\",\"urlname\":\"WriteTogether\",\"description\":\"<p>Writing
        can be difficult and lonely. Sometimes we need to get out and away from our
        own distractions and excuses. Pubs, cafes and parks are nice but wouldn't
        it also be good to be part of a group of writers? So let's work quietly together,
        gently encouraging each other to soldier on, and minding each others things
        when we have to go to the loo... <br> <br> <strong>THE IDEA</strong> <br>
        Is simple. We are a group of serious writers that meet somewhere comfortable
        and write for 2, 3 or 4 hours straight. Each person works on their own and
        sets their own targets. What you write is entirely up to you. But here is
        the difference: you are not alone. Others are around you, typing, scribbling
        or looking out into the distance. Their company will help you stay focused,
        stop you from drifting, and keep on writing. <br> <br> <strong>MEMBERSHIP
        REQUIREMENTS</strong> <br> * A profile photo, preferably a real one <br> *
        A brief description of yourself <br> * A very short answer to the Micro Fiction
        question. Just a sentence or two. It shows us who's serious enough to give
        it a try and thus be more likely to attend meetings. <br> <br> <strong>PART
        1: WRITING SESSION</strong> <br> This is the serious part of the meeting and
        we have strict rules to promote writing: <br> * Distractions must be kept
        to a minimum, so no mobile phones or talking. Just pretend you're in a library.
        Sssh! If you really have to be noisy then do it away from the group. <br>
        * Writers work on their own projects. No sharing or judgement of work. You
        measure your own progress and success. <br> * This is not a critique group.
        This is not a workshop with teachers/mentors or writing exercises. <br> *
        The show must go on! If the host is a no show then find other writers and
        get writing. There are no excuses for not writing. <br> * Keep your RSVP updated.
        It makes it a lot easier for hosts (who may be reserving tables). No shows
        will be recorded and possibly banned. <br> * When events are at a commercial
        venue (e.g. cafe or pub) buy something, anything to make us welcome there.
        Think of it as a venue hire fee. DO NOT bring your own food &amp; drink. This
        makes us look really bad. <br> <br> <strong>PART 2: SOCIAL (optional)</strong>
        <br> Whether this happens depends on the host. Check the event details. This
        is when you are free to talk, socialise and share experiences with fellow
        writers. Almost anything goes. It is also perfectly acceptable to come just
        for the writing and leave politely straight after. Your writing always comes
        first. <br> <br> <strong>WHAT YOU NEED</strong> <br> Bring your unfinished
        project e.g. novel, short story, screenplay, poem etc. <br> Bring pen &amp;
        paper, computer or whatever you like using. If it's electronic please check
        the battery will last because venues might not have power sockets available.
        <br> <br> <strong>MOTIVATIONAL RANT (in case you need it)</strong> <br> Writing
        doesn't happen by itself. It's a constant battle against procrastination,
        distractions and \\\"I'm too tired/busy/bored etc.\\\" Resist all this and
        commit to your passion. Attend our meetings as often as possible. They do
        get easier and you will get better. Just ask our members. <br> <br> I don't
        know how long these meetings will run for. They are free and we do it because
        we love writing. Do not take them for granted. Do not miss opportunities to
        attend. This is completely for you. I say this to push you a little. It feels
        wonderful to call ourselves writers, but let's not forget to do the writing.

        Your Everyday and get active outdoors!</b></p>\\n<p>Do you sit at your desk
        or when you're commuting wishing this year you could escape the boring mundane
        and get away on a weekend or holiday that would be filled with fun, adventure
        and try something new with like minded enthusiasts? Have you always wanted
        to try different sporting activities without having to join a specific club
        or join in on a challenge with a group of like-minded enthusiasts? Who we
        are?</p>\\n<p>We've been organising club trips, challenges and events for
        a number of years. We realised that everyone who enjoys being active outdoors&nbsp;has
        an interest in trying different sports but not necessarily wanting to compete
        at any club or competition level. We finally decided to put together a group
        with a focus on trying different outdoor activities along with some trips
        and challenges that are fun, exciting and above all else, suitable for any
        age group or ability. We will be organising a range of taster events from
        single days and weekends throughout the year for anyone to come along and
        try a new outdoor activity. This will give you an insight into to what it
        will be like to come along on one of our Escape Your Everyday trips and challenges.</p>\\n<p><b>What
        do we do?</b></p>\\n<p>We organise a wide variety of weekend activities for
        everyone to join in, such as trail walking, hiking, climbing road cycling
        and off road biking, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, paddling on the Thames
        - plus much more. We also organise adventures and challenges not just in the
        UK but all over Europe, catering for all abilities. It doesn\\u2019t matter
        if you\\u2019ve never hiked, biked, paddled or skied before, we can accommodate
        you as long as you have a basic level of fitness and a desire to get outdoors.
        Our Activity Leaders are highly experienced and will be on hand to advise
        and support you throughout the event and to ensure your activity experience
        with us is a smooth one.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>How regularly do you meet?&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>We
        running events and trips throughout the year, choosing the right locations
        based on the weather conditions, no mountain climbing in winter! Even when
        the weather is too bad to really enjoy the outdoors, there's always a pub
        to hike or bike to for a meal and social gathering and an opportunity for
        you to meet other enthusiasts or speak to our group leaders. The starting
        point for most activities is normally from central Reading to ensure we can
        arrange enough transportation for anyone travelling by train and we are becoming
        one of the fastest growing outdoor activities clubs serving the Thames Valley,
        London and the South.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Why we do it?&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>Finding
        the motivation to get outdoors on your own every week is not always easy and
        often it's hard to find friends or are able to join in. By setting up this
        group, we have created an active outdoors social club of like minded individuals.
        We\\u2019re passionate about getting outdoor, being active and trying new
        challenges and we want to create the largest outdoors social group in the
        area. We have spent a lot of time planning some really exciting challenges
        for our members, such as the Three Peaks Challenge, London to Paris Off Road
        Bike ride, Coast to Coast Hike and Bike, Cycling Mount Ventoux and Provence,
        Paddle the Thames and the river Severn, Hiking in the French Alps. We\\u2019re
        confident you\\u2019ll find our challenge trips fun and above all an amazing
        social experience where you\\u2019ll meet new friends.</p>\\n<p><b>\\\"Don't

        corner of the world. We also have the fortune to live in a quality and vibrant
        city that is home to people of diverse backgrounds and life experience. The
        Las Vegas International Network gives you an opportunity to experience some
        of the many international cultures that the city hosts, to share your knowledge
        of cultural heritage, interests/hobbies or professional expertise with other
        members of the group, and make new friends while doing so.</p>\\n<p><b>The
        mission of this group is as implied by the name of the group--we'd like to
        provide good company as well as a positive and safe environment for members
        to experience things</b> that, for whatever reasons, you longed for but weren't
        able to do before. You'll also get to know things that you can do and enjoy
        in Las Vegas through the meetups proposed by your peers. It is also a hope
        of our group to promote cross-cultural dialogues, sharing, understanding,
        and peer supports through a variety of local activities and events, as well
        as international trips.</p>\\n<p>But we (organizers) are few and you are many,
        and this means that to work toward these goals we need the proactive participation
        and supports from at least some members of the community. This group is unique
        because of our members, and we look forward to meeting you and facilitate
        the meetup ideas you propose.</p>\\n<p>\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014

        welcome to join us and even provide meeting ideas. Newcomers to Las Vegas
        (from overseas) are also more than welcome to join us and explore Las Vegas
        and Nevada together!</p>\\n<p>We aim at building a safe and friendly community
        with people currently residing in Las Vegas or visiting from overseas. You
        don't need to have experience overseas or be able to speak English to join
        this group. Every friendly person is welcome in this group! (Including people
        local in Las Vegas or (originally) from other parts of the world.)</p>\\n<p>If

        including <i>London, Paris, Las Vegas, New York, LA, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo,
        Hong Kong, Shanghai, Thailand</i>... And more to come!</p>\\n<p>Our only agenda
        is to build up a global community (in the format of meetup groups at this
        stage), where participants get to mix and mingle in a safe and friendly environment,
        have fun and adventures together or establish long-lasting friendship and
        fully enjoy what the city's got to offer.</p>\\n<p>We believe that this service
        can be offered for free, and we need your participation and encouragement
        to make it happen.</p>\\n<p>If you are fond of our vision, welcome to join
        and check it out. Invite your friends who may be interested. We appreciate
        your supports, volunteering, and valuable inputs, but nothing is mandatory

        Your Everyday and get active outdoors!</b></p>\\n<p>Do you sit at your desk
        or when you're commuting wishing this year you could escape the boring mundane
        and get away on a weekend or holiday that would be filled with fun, adventure
        and trying something new with like minded enthusiasts? Have you always wanted
        to try different sporting activities without having to join a specific club
        or join in on an challenge with a group of like-minded enthusiasts? Who we
        are?</p>\\n<p>We've been organising club trips, challenges and events for
        a number of years. We realised that everyone who enjoys being active outdoors&nbsp;has
        an interest in trying different sports but not necessarily wanting to compete
        at any club or competition level. We finally decided to put together a group
        with a focus on trying different outdoor activities along with some trips
        and challenges that are fun, exciting and above all else, suitable for any
        age group or ability. We will be organising a range of taster events from
        single days and weekends throughout the year for anyone to come along and
        try a new outdoor activity. This will give you an insight into to what it
        will be like to come along on one of our Escape Your Everyday trips and challenges.</p>\\n<p><b>What
        do we do?</b></p>\\n<p>We organise a wide variety of weekend activities for
        everyone to join in, such as trail walking, hiking, climbing road cycling
        and off road biking, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, paddling on the Thames
        - plus much more. We also organise adventures and challenges not just in the
        UK but all over Europe, catering for all abilities. It doesn\\u2019t matter
        if you\\u2019ve never hiked, biked, paddled or skied before, we can accommodate
        you as long as you have a basic level of fitness and a desire to get outdoors.
        Our Activity Leaders are all fully qualified to ensure each member is fully
        supported and to ensure your activity experience with us is a smooth one.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span><b>How
        regularly do you meet?</b></span> <br></p>\\n<p>We will be running tasting
        day weekends from the beginning of April. Even when the weather is too bad
        to really enjoy the outdoors, there's always a pub to hike or bike to for
        a meal and social gathering and an opportunity for you to meet other enthusiasts
        or speak to our group leaders. We formed our first group in Reading and found
        we had such a large number of members joining from Oxford we have now set
        up a dedicated Oxford group. The starting point for most activities is normally
        from central Oxford, to ensure we can arrange enough transportation for anyone
        travelling by train and we are becoming one of the fastest growing outdoor
        activities clubs serving the Thames Valley, London and the South.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Why
        we do it?&nbsp;</b></p>\\n<p>Finding the motivation to get outdoors on your
        own every week is not always easy and often it's hard to find friends or are
        able to join in. By setting up this group, we're created an active outdoors
        social club of like minded individuals. We\\u2019re passionate about getting
        outdoor, being active and trying new challenges and we want to create the
        largest outdoors social group in the area. We have spent a lot of time planning
        some really exciting challenges for our members, such as the Three Peaks Challenge,
        London to Paris Off Road Bike ride, Coast to Coast Hike and Bike, Cycling
        Mount Ventoux and Provence, Paddle the Thames and the river Severn, Hiking
        in the French Alps. We\\u2019re confident you\\u2019ll find our challenge
        trips fun and above all an amazing social experience where you\\u2019ll meet
        new friends.</p>\\n<p><b>\\\"Don't limit your challenges - challenge your

        in your twenties you've done all those pub crawls and waded through 99 million
        people to get to bar. All evening you've shouted to the people next to you
        just to ask them their name and what they do for a living, you go home with
        ringing ears and then you get to a realization and now...</p>\\n<p>you'd rather
        discover Picasso or go to a quiet restaurant or listen to some jazz or classical
        music and talk to the person opposite you. If so, this is the group for you.
        The idea is to find a peaceful place to meet new people and discover new art,
        music and culture. Meetups don't have to be limited to the city, anywhere
        in the London area may work out.</p>\\n<p>I hate going to places alone and
        people I know would rather watch Talent X Voice Factor then discover The Proms,
        Jazz or Monet. That's why I started this group to reach out to other people
        like me. Why the thirties focus? I guess the group is aimed towards people
        who are looking to make friends, single, young professionals, postdocs, childfree
        couples, visitors to London who want to enjoy a more quiet and chilled out
        meetup. Having said that, the age range is only a guide and is not strict,
        please join if you feel this sounds like your thing. We're warm, non-pretentious
        and a welcoming bunch.</p>\\n<p>As autumn approaches, we'll be keeping the
        summer of culture alive with more colourful art and sculpture exhibitions, Latin
        music nights, Piano bars, classical music and more warm evenings and days
        out.</p>\\n<p>I really hope you enjoy it in this group and get to meet people

        used to have with my girl friends back in India. And I thought, I\\u2019m
        surely not the only one who feels that way. As we grow up, we get so busy
        with life, work, and family that we forget to focus on our socialising needs.
        The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to find new friends. So if
        you are looking to expand your network of friends, this is the place for you.
        Let\\u2019s build a support network of lovely Iike minded Indian women and

        considered the impact a pair of socks can make?</p>\\n<p>Come with us and
        see! We are a group who engage with the homeless in London by cutting through
        the misconceptions, prejudice and fear that often accompany stereotypes of
        rough sleepers and other vulnerable groups in the city. We walk, sit and talk
        with them in a moment of mutual learning and trust, driven by the ethos of
        unconditional human contact and friendship. Anyone with an open mind and the
        willingness to be challenged and step out of their comfort zone can join The
        Sock Mob!</p>\\n<p>And a simple pair of socks is all it takes to break the
        ice.</p>\\n<p>We meet in small groups, led by a member (either an organiser
        or walk leader). We meet every two weeks - &nbsp;either on a Tuesday or Wednesday
        evening, at a pre-arranged Central London location and walk around for about
        an hour or so. We bring along food, drinks and basic material goods we can
        share with homeless people we have gotten to know over the years, chatting
        and catching up with their news. The main aim is to listen, talk and forge
        meaningful links with them in a completely non-judgemental and agenda-free
        way. Afterwards, members have the option of joining us at a local pub to catch
        up with others from the different routes and to chat about our experiences.&nbsp;
        Occasionally, the RSVPs are closed once our allocations of groups are full,

        Welcome to The Hot Choc Mob! We're currently not going out to avoid inadvertently
        passing on any infection to those we meet, but please do check back and we'll

        well and hope to see you on a mobbing soon! *</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>We're
        a friendly group of volunteers who meet regularly to engage with the homeless
        community on the streets of London. Our purpose is to interact with rough
        sleepers and other vulnerable members of society, while providing hot drinks,
        food, clothing and a chat!&nbsp; <br>The Hot Choc Mob was created by volunteers
        from a wide range of the wonderful groups that regularly help homeless people
        in London. The number of people we see on the streets has risen drastically
        over the past few years, and we felt that this group would offer an opportunity
        for all those who'd like to help them.&nbsp; <br><span>Our main objective
        is to create a little warmth in the lives of people whose daily existence
        can be a struggle. We seek to approach all those we meet with an open-minded
        spirit of empathy and solidarity, and are not affiliated with any charity
        or religious ideology.&nbsp; <br></span><span>The Hot Choc Mob's meetups involve
        going out in small groups, led by one of our walk leaders, for an hour or
        so, during which we share the provisions we have and talk with/listen to those
        we meet.&nbsp; <br></span><span>And afterwards, we like to regroup at a local
        pub for a catch-up!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>If you'd like to help, but can't make
        our regular Tuesday outings, our friends the Pavement People (also on Meetup)
        go out on other days of the week.&nbsp; <br></span><span>Please feel free
        to join us, and if you have any questions, you can message any of our group
        leaders or text Lynn on 07970983340. We look forward to seeing you on a mobbing

        \\n<br>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p>Hello there! We'd like to welcome you to our FREE
        weekly Sahaja Yoga meditation meetings hosted by Essi which take place in
        Chelmsford, &nbsp;(Phone Essi - 01245348413, MOBILE: 07442019559 )&nbsp; </p>\\n<p><span>The
        Nook centre is behind the houses or &nbsp;behind Panache &nbsp;Hair dressing
        saloon (opposite to King Arm pub). &nbsp;</span><span>You can open the heavy
        wooden gate and follow the path behind the houses (i.e it is well lighted).</span></p>\\n<p>With
        Sahaja Yoga Meditation we generally sit on chairs to achieve Yoga, effortlessly
        &amp; spontaneously. As such no Asanas (exercises) are required, no mat or
        special clothing. We are all volunteers of a Charity organisation and have
        many years of experience in offering free Sahaja Yoga Meditation classes.</p>\\n<p>The
        classes are designed to help those attending get into a genuine meditative
        state, which can be felt tangibly. It is quite effortless and spontaneous.
        The free classes feature introductory talks, video's, practical workshops
        and general question and answer opportunities, making them perfect for seekers
        trying to establish a state of yoga, and they are available across London
        most evenings and throughout the UK. The idea is that you don't do yoga -
        you Achieve Yoga!</p>\\n<p>Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple, time-honored
        technique. It helps those who enjoy it, reduce stress and increase wellness.
        It brings better focus and helps people become more centered and better balanced.
        Anyone can do it. Founded by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Sahaja Yoga Meditation
        is a world wide movement for peace and self awakening. All the meetings and
        classes are free of any charge.</p>\\n<p>Each week we go through simple meditation
        techniques, often with guided meditations to help reduce stress and achieve
        the peace of true meditation.</p>\\n<p>We share tips on how to help stay in
        balance during the day and how to meditate at home. The meditation is based
        on connecting with the inner chakras (energy centres) and balancing the subtle
        body. The tradition and aims of meditation are explained which in essence
        is to be in the present with no mental activity or thoughts about the past
        or the future.</p>\\n<p>Occasionally there are 1 day retreats to help those
        interested, deepen their individual experience and hear advice and tips from
        those who have been practicing for some time. It\\u2019s ultimately all about
        getting into \\u2018thoughtless awareness\\u2019, a natural state of being.</p>\\n<p>We

        success. &lt;br&gt;\\u2022 This is not a critique group. This is not a workshop
        with teachers/mentors or writing exercises. &lt;br&gt;\\u2022 The show must
        go on! If the host is a no show then find other writers and get writing. There
        are no excuses for not writing. &lt;br&gt;\\u2022 Keep your RSVP updated.
        It makes it a lot easier for hosts (who may be reserving tables). No shows
        will be recorded and possibly banned. &lt;br&gt;\\u2022 When events are at
        a commercial venue (e.g. cafe or pub) buy something, anything to make us welcome
        there. &lt;br&gt;\\u2022 You can take a break or leave early as you need,
        but please do not talk to others while they are writing.</p> \\n<p>PART 2:
        Social and communication</p> \\n<p>It's most important for the creative persons
        for communicating with many various persons.Luckily,in this attractive city,Tokyo,there
        are many talented people from all over the world who want the intellectual
        encounter sincerely.This meet up also try to offer them the good chance as
        possible.</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \\n<p>MOTIVATIONAL
        RANT (in case you need it) &lt;br&gt; Writing doesn't happen by itself. It's
        a constant battle against procrastination, distractions and \\\"I'm too tired/busy/bored
        etc.\\\" Resist all this and commit to your passion. Attend our meetings as
        often as possible. They do get easier and you will get better. Just ask our
        members.</p> \\n<p>Special Thanks! &lt;br&gt; This Meetup Group was inspired

        style=\\\"font-size : small\\\"><span><strong>Focused, Quiet Writing Time
        in the Company of Other Writers.</strong></span></span></p>\\n<p>This group
        was inspired by the London Writing Together group and is for people in or
        near Brighton who write or who seriously want to.</p>\\n<p>The format is simple:
        a host organises a session anywhere comfortable, e.g. in a café or peaceful
        pub, in their lounge, or maybe in a random nearby village. We then write for
        an hour and a half straight. We work on our own and set our own targets. What
        you write is up to you.</p>\\n<p>The whole point is: you are not alone in
        the creative process. Others are around you, typing, scribbling or looking
        out into the distance. Their company will help you stay focused, stop you
        from drifting, and keep on writing.</p>\\n<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>\\n<p>*
        Distractions must be kept to a minimum, so no mobile phones, internet or talking.
        Just pretend you're in a library. Sssh!</p>\\n<p>* If you really have to do
        be noisy, then do it away from the group.</p>\\n<p>* Writers work on their
        own projects. No sharing or judgement of work (during any socialising at the
        end, writers may agree to share each others' work \\\"outside the group\\\"
        if they wish).</p>\\n<p>* The show must go on! If the host is a no show then
        find the other writers and get writing. There are no excuses for not writing.</p>\\n<p>*
        When events are at a commercial venue (e.g. cafe, restaurant) buy something,
        anything to make us welcome there. Think of it as a venue fee. DO NOT bring
        your own food &amp; drink. This makes us look really bad.</p>\\n<p><strong>WHAT
        WE ARE NOT</strong></p>\\n<p>* We are not a critique or workshop group. Your
        work will not be reviewed. However, this does not stop members from organising
        workshop-style meetups separately from this group if they wish.</p>\\n<p>*
        We are not a social group during the writing. People work in silence. We can
        do the socialising after sessions.</p>\\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU NEED</strong></p>\\n<p>Bring
        your unfinished project e.g. novel, short story, screenplay, poem etc. Bring
        pen &amp; paper, computer or whatever you like using. If it's electronic please
        check the battery will last because venues might not have power sockets available
        (check with the organiser on this) .</p>\\n<p><strong>AFTERWARDS</strong></p>\\n<p>After
        the session time is up, we are free to talk, socialise and share experiences
        with fellow writers. Almost anything goes. We might decide to go for a drink
        or a walk by the sea. It is also perfectly acceptable to come just for the
        writing and leave politely straight after.</p>\\n<p><strong>BEING A HOST</strong></p>\\n<p>Writers
        want to write as much as they can. Let's make it happen. With such a simple
        idea, it should be possible for lots of hosts to run regular meetups all over
        the place. The more choices the better. Here are some guidelines:</p>\\n<p>*
        Anyone can suggest an event</p>\\n<p>* Event title must start with hours and
        location e.g. \\\"2hrs at the Splendid Cafe\\\"</p>\\n<p>* First-time host
        must run one event before adding more events (i.e. do one and see if you like
        it)</p>\\n<p>* Meetings should be at a venue and time that is convenient to
        the host, so that they are happy to run them often</p>\\n<p><strong>GENERAL
        THOUGHTS</strong></p>\\n<p><span>I don't know how long these meetups will
        run for. I am keeping them free of charge and they should arise out of a love
        of writing and a passion for the literary and creative journey, which it can
        be so fulfilling to share with others, whether in silence or through the the
        socialising that can ensue afterwards.</span></p>\\n<p>I want these meetups
        to be enjoyable and productive. If you have an idea to share, please message
        me. Feel free to suggest suitable venues as well as they are not always easy
        to find. We can also organise other forms of literary meetups and activities,
        depending on the wishes of members.</p>\\n<p>Thank you for reading. Until
        we meet,</p>\\n<p>Thomas</p>\\n<p><strong>Current organiser's note:</strong></p>\\n<p>I
        took over running this group from someone who took over from Thomas, and while
        I've edited the above statement, and generally agree with it, the group as
        it is now is more relaxed than the bold caps and rules make out. It is still
        very much about quiet, focused writing though, so if you have a project -
        anything from a novel to an academic paper - please come along and enjoy the
        unique atmosphere of writing in the company of other writers.</p>\\n<p>Richard</p>\",\"created\":1341849815000,\"city\":\"Brighton\",\"untranslated_city\":\"Brighton\",\"country\":\"GB\",\"localized_country_name\":\"United

        six years we have run free events and offered structured paid for courses.

        to Cheltenham Film-Makers; a friendly, inclusive group where members can collaborate,
        hone their various skills and collectively create some great footage as well
        as having some fun along the way.</p>\\n<p>If you live in or near Cheltenham,
        enjoy shooting digital video on your DLSR, recording audio, editing, lighting,
        script writing or being in front of the camera then this might well be the
        group for you to get involved with.</p>\\n<p>Members should have more than
        a passing interest in any, or all, aspects of video production and a desire
        to join and work with others to create some short films/documentaries, learning
        and having some fun along the way. Ideally there will be a core who have more
        experience but so long as those joining have enthusiasm that'll be enough.
        If you've dabbled with shooting video, recording audio, editing either/both
        on your PC or are interested in writing or being in front if the camera and
        would like to meet people who share this then you should give this a go.</p>\\n<p>The
        idea is to have a few meetings to decide on and plan an initial project, this
        in part will depend on the abilities and aspirations of those who sign up
        and attend. Unfortunately, given the current restrictions, this will be via
        zoom until such a time that we can all meet in person.</p>\\n<p>Once restrictions
        have sufficiently eased we will be able to begin shooting our first production.
        Would also suggest a regular meet at a Cheltenham pub or bar for a social,
        meeting any new members and a chat about how any ongoing project is going.</p>\\n<p>The
        first zoom meeting will be set for mid-April to allow time for the group to
        gain a few members. In this inaugural meeting, after introductions, those
        attending will hopefully suggest, debate ideas and decide/vote on a genre
        for our first project. It\\u2019s going to be an interesting journey, why
        not sign up, join the discussion and see where this takes us!</p>\\n<p>As
        the organiser I should expand on a bit more about me than the scant group
        profile will allow: I've been recently shooting some video in the course of
        my work, somewhat boring corporate interviews, but have previously worked
        on a couple of other more interesting projects. I'm self-taught and still
        learning, that never ends, and want to explore creative film making with a
        group of like-minded people free of constraints imposed by commercial briefings.</p>\\n<p>I
        should add that, in what seems like a previous life, I worked as a photographer
        running my own studio in London and still shoot some stills for a few clients.
        A few years ago one asked if I could shoot video for them... That's where
        my serious interest in video started from.</p>\\n<p>Want to open a dialogue
        with the group? Then please use the discussion page to post questions, ideas
        etc.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.meetup.com/cheltenham-film-makers/discussions/\\\"

        run include\\u2026</b></p>\\n<p>**Our very Popular \\\"New Members make lots
        of new Friends Night\\\" - Where you get a chance to meet lots of new people
        in one evening! You are seated with 4 people to chat for 15-20 mins, then
        (a bit like musical chairs) everyone gets up and moves to another table to
        meet another group of 4 people. Then we keep swapping the groups around every
        15-20 Minutes, to give you the best chance to meet lots of people in 1 night.</p>\\n<p>
        &nbsp;**Social Meet Ups - Where we try to reserve a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;area
        for the group to come together in a pub and meet other Putney Social members.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>**We
        also run a monthly Co-Working Day for Freelancers on the last Friday of the
        month.</p>\\n<p><span>**In the summer months we have our Social Meet Ups by
        the river next to Putney cinema and attract 60-100 people.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\\n<p><img

        POLICY (SUSPENDED DURING COVID): Some of are events involve table bookings

        established a strict (yet flexible) No-Show Policy. Members will have a limit
        of 2 \\\"No-Show Flags\\\" before not being able to attend future meetups.
        To avoid being Flagged please inform us prior to the meetup if can't or won't
        be attending. You can do this by moving your RSVP option from \\\"Going\\\"
        to \\\"Not Going\\\". You can also erase a flag status as long as it doesn't
        reach 2 times when you show up to the next event and informing the host.</p>\\n<p>PREVIOUSLY
        FLAGGED MEMBERS (SUSPENDED DURING COVID):: If you have been previously flagged
        as \\\"Not Showed\\\" at previous meetup(s) please be aware that unfortunately
        you may be removed from the RSVP lists in favour for others members to go.
        This will only happen if a table has been reserved and if there are strict
        restaurant bar policies. You will still be able to join the meet-up on a Non-RSVP
        basis just compromising on what we can do on the day. Your Flagged status
        is normally removed once you showed up to any next event and informing the

        of the Oak is a group that was started as an interface for people from different
        Pagan and occult paths to exchange and discuss ideas and to create a safe
        space for newcomers to come and find information about the London Pagan scene.
        Meetings are held in The Sir John Oldcastle, a Wetherspoons pub, next to Farringdon
        Station, from 3 to 7pm, on the 3rd Sunday of every month from January to November
        for socialising and discussion on all aspects of Paganism, Wicca and witchcraft,
        Heathen and Druid beliefs and other esoteric groups. The meetings are open
        to all with a genuine and respectful interest in Pagan and occult matters;
        the atmosphere is relaxed and informal, there is no entry fee and you can
        be assured of a warm and friendly welcome from the regulars whatever your
        level of knowledge. There is an A4 notice with our logo showing which table
        we are using and the bar staff can point you in our direction. They have wheelchair
        ramps for the few steps into the bar and the staff are always helpful. (Please

        Club is an English social club. It\\u2019s a place for members and hosts to
        talk about global culture, to get to know each other, to learn new skills
        and to become part of an international community. So many people in China
        work really hard to improve their English but, although their language skills
        are good enough, when they meet a Westerner, they simply have nothing to talk
        about. Popcorn Club can fix that. <br> <br>Popcorn Club是一个英语社交俱乐部。在这里，会员和东道主们可以谈论全球文化，在互相了解的过程中学习新技能，并成为国际社会的一员。在中国，很多人都非常努力地学习英语，尽管他们的语言技能已经足够优秀，但当他们遇到西方人时，却常常无话可说。于是Popcorn
        Club应运而生。</p>\\n<p>In regular clubs, our friendly and knowledgeable, international
        hosts will introduce a topic to you and then we\\u2019ll all discuss it. Club
        topics include: business, music, movies, art, current events, literature and
        so much more. We talk about the same things you\\u2019ll hear in a conversation
        at a pub in London or at a park in New York. <br> <br>在常规俱乐部里，我们友好而博学的国际主持人会向你介绍一个话题，然后大家一起展开讨论。俱乐部主题包括:商业、音乐、电影、艺术、时事、文学等等。我们谈论的事情,往往和你在伦敦酒吧或纽约公园里听到的一样。</p>\\n<p>In

        Together started as Write Together - and focused solely on the written word
        - but has since expanded to also running separate meetups for visual artists,
        under the heading Art Together, too! The idea started in London (</p>\\n<p><a
        href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/WriteTogether/\\\">http://www.meetup.com/WriteTogether/</a></p>\\n<p>)
        and the Sydney group inspired a spin-off in Osaka, Japan too! (</p>\\n<p><a

        href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/Write-Together-Sydney/about/\\\">http://www.meetup.com/Write-Together-Sydney/about/</a></p>\\n<p>)</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Being
        creative can be difficult and lonely. Sometimes we need to get out and away
        from our own distractions and excuses. Pubs, cafes and parks are nice but
        wouldn't it also be good to be part of a group of other writers and artists?
        So let's work quietly together, gently encouraging each other to soldier on,
        and minding each others things when we have to go to the loo! :)</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>THE
        IDEA</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>It\\u2019s simple! We are a bunch of writers and
        artists that meet somewhere comfortable and work on our own projects. Each
        person works on their own work and sets their own targets. What you create
        is entirely up to you, but here is the difference: you are not alone. Others
        are around you, typing, scribbling or looking out into the distance. Their
        company will help you stay focused, stop you from drifting, and keep on creating!</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>THE
        RULES</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 The primary rule is to not distract others
        from working on their work.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 Distractions are
        subjective and vary. Write Together events tend to be quieter as writing is
        harder if people are talking while Art Together tends to be a bit looser on
        the noise limits. The Host will keep things under control.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022
        People work on their own stuff and measure their own success - it\\u2019s

        and afterwards about how we\\u2019re going.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022

        own work.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>WHAT YOU NEED</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022
        Write Together: pen and paper, computer or whatever you like using to write.
        It can be good to have something to work on, such as a novel, short story,
        screenplay, poem etc, but it\\u2019s not required - why not see where it takes
        you?</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>\\u2022 Art Together: pens, pencils, paints, paper,
        graphics tablets - whatever you use to get arty! You can sketch people around
        you or work on existing projects!</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Some venues will
        have power points, some will have Wi-fi, but it\\u2019s not guaranteed.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>AFTERWARDS</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>After
        the session time is up you are free to talk, socialise and share experiences
        with fellow creatives. Almost anything goes. Sometimes we go out for a drink.
        It is also perfectly acceptable to come just for the session and leave politely
        straight after, or arrive late or leave early. Your work always comes first!</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>MOTIVATIONAL
        RANT (in case you need it)</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Creating something doesn't
        happen by itself. It's a constant battle against procrastination, distractions
        and \\\"I'm too tired/busy/bored etc.\\\" Resist all this and commit to your
        passion. Attend our meetings as often as possible as the more you do the easier
        it gets and you in turn will get better. Just ask our members!</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>BEING
        A HOST</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>Creative people want to work as much as they
        can so let's make it happen! With such a simple idea, it should be possible
        for lots of hosts to run regular meetings all over the place. The more choices
        the better, right? Also, it\\u2019s super easy and then people turn up wherever
        suits you to keep you working. If you\\u2019re interested in hosting a Write

        Art Together and more!","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/CreateTogether/","urlname":"CreateTogether","description":"<p>Create
        Together started as Write Together - and focused solely on the written word
        - but has since expanded to also running separate meetups for visual artists,
        under the heading Art Together, too! The idea <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WriteTogether/\"><b>started
        in London</b></a> and the Sydney group inspired a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Pen-and-Note/\"><b>spin-off
        in Osaka, Japan too!</b></a>&nbsp;You can learn more about the history of
        the group <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Write-Together-Sydney/about/\"><b>on
        this page.</b></a></p>\n<p>Being creative can be difficult and lonely. Sometimes
        we need to get out and away from our own distractions and excuses. Pubs, cafes
        and parks are nice but wouldn''t it also be good to be part of a group of
        other writers and artists? So let''s work quietly together, gently encouraging
        each other to soldier on, and minding each others things when we have to go
        to the loo! :)</p>\n<p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s simple! We
        are a bunch of writers and artists that meet somewhere comfortable and work
        on our own projects. Each person works on their own work and sets their own
        targets. What you create is entirely up to you, but here is the difference:
        you are not alone. Others are around you, typing, scribbling or looking out
        into the distance. Their company will help you stay focused, stop you from
        drifting, and keep on creating!</span></p>\n<p><b>THE RULES</b></p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;The
        primary rule is to not distract others from working on their work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Distractions
        are subjective and vary. Write Together events tend to be quieter as writing
        is harder if people are talking while Art Together tends to be a bit looser
        on the noise limits. The Host will keep things under control.</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;People
        work on their own stuff and measure their own success - it\u2019s not about
        critiquing or workshopping although we\u2019ll often chat before and afterwards
        about how we\u2019re going.</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;The most important thing of
        all: have fun! :)</p>\n<p><span><b>WHAT WE ARE NOT...</b></span></p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;\u2026a

        pen and paper, computer or whatever you like using to write. It can be good
        to have something to work on, such as a novel, short story, screenplay, poem
        etc, but it\u2019s not required - why not see where it takes you?</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<b>Art

        has the following objectives <br> <br>1) To allow Wiccans to connect with
        like minded individuals through our network of Watsapp groups. <br> <br>2)
        To offer training online through the 13 Knots course, and face to face training
        for those who progress to joining a coven. <br> <br>3) To allow members to
        meet like minded individuals who are interested in the tradituon in pub and
        coffee shop based meetings in London and through Zoom conferencing for members
        around the UK <br> <br>4) To provide a way for individuals to join a Wiccan
        coven, facilitating the practice of Wiccan rites. <br> <br>5) To allow those
        interested in Wicca to meet with others interested on a national basis particularly
        on Dartmoor. <br> <br>6) To provide access to written material on Wicca that
        is written from the perspective of those practicing in a coven setting to
        ensure that new members understand how experienced Wiccans practice. <br>
        <br>The group provides a straightforward access point to the Wiccan tradition
        and we are dedicated to facilitating access to initiatory coven Wicca for
        all seekers. <br> <br>Our Order website is below <br> <br><a href=\"http://ootham.wordpress.com/\">http://ootham.wordpress.com</a>&nbsp;(<a
        href=\"http://ootham.wordpress.com/\">http://ootham.wordpress.com/</a>) <br>
        <br>We also run a major Wicca website at <br> <br><a href=\"http://www.wicca.org.uk/\">http://www.wicca.org.uk</a>&nbsp;(<a
        href=\"http://www.wicca.org.uk/\">http://www.wicca.org.uk/</a>) <br> <br>The
        Wiccan Federation and its associated covens also hold a number of events not
        on meetup which are for the members associated with the covens. Although the
        covens are spiritual groups they are also groups of friends and hold their
        own gatherings. <br> <br>We try to avoid bringing members to events in private
        houses who are unknown to our network unless they are with a friend we know.
        Additionally we are a group for Wiccans. Our focus is on those seeking to
        join the Wiccan path. <br> <br>The group is also limited to the over 21s.
        We have special arrangements for those who are 20.</p>\n<br>\n<p> <br></p>","created":1395610764000,"city":"Chagford","untranslated_city":"Chagford","country":"GB","localized_country_name":"United
